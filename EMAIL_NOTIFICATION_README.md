# Email Notification Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of email notifications for test attempt completions in the SAT Practice application.

## Overview

The system now sends email notifications when a user completes a test attempt. The email includes:
- Test name
- User's score (number correct and percentage)
- Time taken to complete the test 
- Links to review the test attempt and retake the test
- Detailed breakdown of questions answered incorrectly, including:
  - Question text (stem)
  - Stimulus text (if available)
  - All answer options labeled as A, B, C, D, etc.
  - The user's selected answer (highlighted in red)
  - The correct answer (highlighted in green)
  - Explanation for each question

## Implementation Details

### Backend

The backend already had most of the required functionality implemented:

1. **Email Service** (`emailService.ts`):
   - Uses Nodemailer to send emails
   - Provides HTML templates for professional-looking emails
   - Includes test attempt completion email with score, time, and links

2. **Email Controller** (`emailController.ts`):
   - Handles the HTTP request for sending test attempt emails
   - Validates required parameters
   - Gets the user's email and notification preferences

3. **Email Routes** (`emailRoutes.ts`):
   - Exposes the `/api/email/test-attempt` endpoint

### Frontend

The frontend has been updated to integrate with this backend functionality:

1. **API Service** (`api.ts`):
   - Already included a `sendTestAttemptEmail` function that calls the backend endpoint

2. **User Settings Service** (`userSettingsService.ts`):
   - Updated `sendTestAttemptNotifications` to use the API service
   - Added proper error handling and return values

3. **Test View Component** (`TestView.tsx`):
   - Updated the `submitTest` function to:
     - Calculate time taken for the test
     - Call the updated notification function with all required parameters
     - Handle success/failure of email sending

## Testing

To test this functionality:

1. Complete a test as a logged-in user
2. The system will save the test attempt to Firestore
3. The system will automatically send an email notification with the test results
4. Check the logs for confirmation of successful email sending

## Requirements

- Backend server running on port 4000
- Valid email configuration in the backend `.env` file:
  - `EMAIL_HOST`
  - `EMAIL_PORT`
  - `EMAIL_USER`
  - `EMAIL_PASS`
  - `EMAIL_FROM`
  - `BASE_URL`

## Future Enhancements

- Add user interface for managing notification email preferences
- Add email templates for other events (test creation, study reminders, etc.)
- Implement unsubscribe functionality for notification emails
