# Backend Changes Summary

## Email Notification System

### Test Attempt Completion Email

We've implemented a complete email notification system for test attempt completion:

1. **Email Service**  
   - Created a robust email service with Nodemailer
   - Implemented professional HTML templates for emails
   - Added support for both primary and secondary notification recipients
   - Included fallbacks for when email configuration is missing

2. **API Endpoint**  
   - Created a new endpoint at `/api/email/test-attempt`
   - Implemented proper validation of required parameters
   - Added error handling for missing user emails
   - Integrated with user settings to retrieve user preferences

3. **Email Content**  
   - Dynamically generated email with test results
   - Included score (both raw and percentage)
   - Added time taken information
   - Generated links for:
     - Reviewing the completed test
     - Retaking the test

4. **Documentation**  
   - Updated API_DOCS.md to include the new endpoint
   - Created EMAIL_DOCS.md with detailed integration instructions
   - Updated README.md to reflect new features
   - Added sample code for frontend integration

## Integration with Frontend

For the frontend to use this new functionality, it should:

1. After a test attempt is completed, save the attempt to Firestore
2. Calculate the score and time taken
3. Call the `/api/email/test-attempt` endpoint with the required information:
   - User ID
   - Test ID
   - Test attempt ID
   - Test name
   - Score achieved
   - Total questions
   - Time taken (in seconds)

This will trigger an email notification to be sent to:
- The user's primary email (from Firebase Auth)
- Any additional notification emails configured in the user's settings

## Next Steps

1. Integrate the API call into the frontend test completion flow
2. Add user settings UI for managing notification preferences
3. Consider adding email templates for other events (test retakes, study reminders, etc.)
4. Add unsubscribe functionality for notification emails
