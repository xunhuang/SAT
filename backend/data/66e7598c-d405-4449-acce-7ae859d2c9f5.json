  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. It&rsquo;s the only choice that offers a form of the verb &ldquo;acknowledge&rdquo; that can go with the subject &ldquo;International Astronomical Union&rdquo; to make a complete sentence. This might seem like an odd use of &ldquo;would,&rdquo; but when speaking from a point of view in the past, we can actually use &ldquo;would&rdquo; to express something that happened later. That&rsquo;s the case here: 200 years after Wang Zhenyi&rsquo;s death, the IAU would finally acknowledge her contributions. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. There&rsquo;s no main verb elsewhere in the sentence, so we need a form of the verb &ldquo;acknowledge&rdquo; that can go with the subject &ldquo;the International Astronomical Union&rdquo; and serve as that main verb. &ldquo;To acknowledge&rdquo; can&rsquo;t do that. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. There&rsquo;s no main verb elsewhere in the sentence, so we need a form of the verb &ldquo;acknowledge&rdquo; that can go with the subject &ldquo;the International Astronomical Union&rdquo; and serve as that main verb. &ldquo;Having acknowledged&rdquo; can&rsquo;t do that. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. There&rsquo;s no main verb elsewhere in the sentence, so we need a form of the verb &ldquo;acknowledge&rdquo; that can go with the subject &ldquo;the International Astronomical Union&rdquo; and serve as that main verb. The &ldquo;-ing&rdquo; form can&rsquo;t do that. </p>",
