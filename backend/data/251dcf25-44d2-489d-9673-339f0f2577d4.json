  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a difference between baking soda and baking powder, noting that baking soda needs to be mixed with an acidic ingredient to produce carbon dioxide but baking powder doesn&rsquo;t. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence focuses on what bakers use to make batters rise; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between baking soda and baking powder. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence provides a general description of baking soda and baking powder; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between them. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence explains what baking soda and honey are; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between baking soda and baking powder. </p>",
