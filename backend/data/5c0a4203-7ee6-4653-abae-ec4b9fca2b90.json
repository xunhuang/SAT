  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence uses &ldquo;whereas&rdquo; to contrast the emissivities of the two fibers, noting that the emissivity of the reflective metal fibers was just 0.02, far lower than that of the silicon carbide fibers (0.74). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes the ability of reflective metal fibers and silicon carbide fibers to emit heat; it doesn&rsquo;t contrast the emissivities of the two fibers. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence states a law of thermodynamics: the amount of heat a material absorbs is equal to the amount it emits. The sentence doesn&rsquo;t contrast the emissivity of reflective metal fibers with that of silicon carbide fibers. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence includes a generalization about the emissivities of reflective metal fibers and silicon carbide fibers, it emphasizes Abebe&rsquo;s plans for their use in a garment; it doesn&rsquo;t contrast the emissivities of the two fibers. </p>",
