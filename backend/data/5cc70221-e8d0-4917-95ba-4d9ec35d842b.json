The sentence effectively emphasizes the aim, or goal, of the research study (in other words, what the researchers hoped to learn from the study): Rogers and Russell wanted to know if woodland expansion is related to changes in climate. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes the researchers&rsquo; findings; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize the aim of the study. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes the results of the study; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize the aim. Choice D is incorrect.
