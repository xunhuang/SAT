  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma before the coordinating conjunction \"but\" to join the first main clause (\"This bat-and-ball game was derived from cricket\") and the second main clause (\"kilikiti differs from cricket in a few key ways\").</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. When coordinating two main clauses such as these, it&rsquo;s not conventional to use a colon in this way after the coordinating conjunction. Choice B is incorrect. When coordinating two main clauses such as these, it&rsquo;s not conventional to use a comma in this way after the coordinating conjunction. Choice D is incorrect. When coordinating two main clauses such as these, it&rsquo;s not conventional to use a comma in this way after the coordinating conjunction.</p>",
