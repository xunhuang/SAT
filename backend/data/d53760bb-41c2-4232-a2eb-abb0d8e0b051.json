C&aacute;ceres and co. would probably not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way.

C&aacute;ceres and co&rsquo;s findings directly undermine this view: they found no difference in eventual diversity between a zooplankton pool that started out diverse and a zooplankton pool that started out with only a single species. Choice B is incorrect. C&aacute;ceres and co. would probably not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way. Their experiment was designed to test this hypothesis, and their findings were \"contrary to their expectations.\" In other words, before the study, they predicted the theory was correct. Choice D is incorrect. C&aacute;ceres and co. would not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way. Their research finding directly undermines the view presented in Text 1: so it definitely doesn&rsquo;t hold true in conditions like those in the study.</p>",

Some theorists have argued that historical diversity is a major driver of how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes: differences in community diversity across otherwise similar habitats, in this view, are strongly affected by the number of species living in those habitats at earlier times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Text 2</p>\n<p>In 2010, a group of researchers including biologist Carla C&aacute;ceres created artificial pools in a New York forest. They stocked some pools with a diverse mix of zooplankton species and others with a single zooplankton species and allowed the pool communities to develop naturally thereafter. Over the course of four years, C&aacute;ceres and colleagues periodically measured the species diversity of the pools, finding&mdash;contrary to their expectations&mdash;that by the end of the study there was little to no difference in the pools&rsquo; species diversity.&nbsp;</p>",
