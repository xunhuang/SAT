  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence contrasts Minnesota&rsquo;s definition of a lake with Wisconsin&rsquo;s, explaining that Minnesota&rsquo;s definition (which takes size into account) is more restrictive than Wisconsin&rsquo;s definition (which doesn&rsquo;t). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence notes that Wisconsin&rsquo;s definition of a lake doesn&rsquo;t take size into account, it doesn&rsquo;t contrast Minnesota&rsquo;s definition with Wisconsin&rsquo;s. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence states that Wisconsin&rsquo;s definition of a lake is different from Minnesota&rsquo;s, but it doesn&rsquo;t clarify how they differ. In other words, it doesn&rsquo;t contrast Minnesota&rsquo;s definition with Wisconsin&rsquo;s. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence indicates how many lakes Wisconsin has according to Minnesota&rsquo;s definition of a lake, but it doesn&rsquo;t clarify how the states&rsquo; definitions differ. In other words, it doesn&rsquo;t contrast Minnesota&rsquo;s definition with Wisconsin&rsquo;s. </p>",
