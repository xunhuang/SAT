This choice uses a semicolon in a conventional way to join the first main clause (\"The Lim&oacute;n&hellip;weightlessness\") and the second main clause (\"dancers&hellip;jump\").</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice B is incorrect. The relative pronoun \"which\" can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two main clauses.</p>",
