  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. This choice uses a semicolon in a conventional way to join the first main clause (\"In many&hellip;rare\") and the second main clause (\"in some&hellip;common\") in this sentence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Joining the first main clause (\"In many&hellip;rare\") and the second main clause (\"in some...common\") with the conjunction \"and\" conflicts with the use of \"however\" later in the sentence, resulting in a confusing and illogical sentence. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.</p>",
