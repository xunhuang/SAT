  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is pronoun&ndash;antecedent agreement. The singular pronoun &ldquo;it&rdquo; agrees in number with the singular antecedent &ldquo;violin&rdquo; and thus indicates that the traditional violin (and not its curves) was made lighter. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the plural pronoun &ldquo;those&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t agree in number with the singular antecedent &ldquo;violin.&rdquo; Choice B is incorrect because the singular pronoun &ldquo;one&rdquo; is ambiguous in this context; the resulting sentence leaves unclear what Stradivari made lighter.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the plural pronoun &ldquo;them&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t agree in number with the singular antecedent &ldquo;violin.&rdquo; </p>",
