  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text states that some scholars have dated the composition of <em>Beowulf</em> to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries due to the poem&rsquo;s fit with that period&rsquo;s historical context. The text goes on to say that while it is &ldquo;not inconceivable that <em>Beowulf</em> emerged from such a context&rdquo;&mdash;that is, it is possible that <em>Beowulf</em> was composed during the late ninth through eleventh centuries&mdash;there is linguistic evidence that the poem was composed earlier, in the seventh or eighth century. According to the text, favoring the historical context over the linguistic evidence requires justification that scholars have not yet supplied. In other words, the text suggests that scholars who favor the later composition date need to explain why the poem&rsquo;s fit with historical context should take precedence over the linguistic evidence, but they have not yet done so. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while there is some plausibility to the later composition date, advocates for the later date have not compellingly addressed evidence suggestive of an earlier date.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text says that scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to account for the linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier, not that the evidence those scholars cite in favor of their view is unreliable or that anyone has cast doubt on that evidence. In other words, the text does not suggest that there are problems with the evidence cited by advocates of the later composition date, only that there is other evidence of an earlier composition date that those advocates need to consider.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that those scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries are giving priority to a controversial view of the social conditions at that time. The text makes no reference to any controversy about how scholars interpret that historical period. Instead, the text suggests that scholars who date the poem on the basis of its fit with the historical context of England in the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to account for linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how well the poem fits the historical context of England in the seventh and eighth centuries, let alone that it fits that historical context as well as it fits the historical context of the late ninth through early eleventh centuries. Rather, the text says that there is linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed in the seventh or eighth century.&nbsp;</p>",

  "stimulus": "<p>Several scholars have argued that conditions in England in the late ninth through early eleventh centuries&mdash;namely, burgeoning literacy amid running conflicts between England&rsquo;s Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and Danish invaders&mdash;were especially conducive to the production of the Old English epic poem <em>Beowulf</em>, and they have dated the poem&rsquo;s composition accordingly. It is not inconceivable that <em>Beowulf</em> emerged from such a context, but privileging contextual fit over the linguistic evidence of an eighth- or even seventh-century composition requires a level of justification that thus far has not been presented.</p>",
