The plural pronoun \"these\" neither agrees in number with the singular antecedent \"industry\" nor clearly indicates that the industry&mdash;not another plural noun in the sentence, such as \"start-up costs\" or \"barriers\"&mdash;consists of just one or two suppliers per municipality. Choice B is incorrect because the plural pronoun \"they\" doesn&rsquo;t agree in number with the singular antecedent \"industry.\" Choice D is incorrect because the singular pronoun \"this\" is ambiguous in this context; the resulting sentence leaves unclear what consists of just one or two suppliers per municipality.</p>",
