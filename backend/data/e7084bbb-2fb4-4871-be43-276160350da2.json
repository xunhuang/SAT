  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between sentences. In this choice, the period is used to correctly mark the boundary between one sentence (\"Jamaican&hellip;microsculptures\") and another (\"Creations&hellip;strands\"). The noun phrase beginning with \"creations\" modifies the subject of the next sentence, \"Wigan&rsquo;s sculptures.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (\"Jamaican&hellip;microsculptures\" and \"Creations&hellip;strands\") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice D is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction \"and\" can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join sentences.</p>",
