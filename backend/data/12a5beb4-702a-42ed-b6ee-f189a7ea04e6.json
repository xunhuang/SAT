  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of items in a series. The comma after &ldquo;themselves&rdquo; is used conventionally to separate the first item (&ldquo;they can clone themselves&rdquo;) and the second item (&ldquo;enter a dormant state in times of drought&rdquo;) in the series of things mosses can do.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a semicolon can&rsquo;t be used in this way to separate items in a simple series such as this. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with &ldquo;And enter.&rdquo; Choice D is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the first and second items in the series. </p>",
