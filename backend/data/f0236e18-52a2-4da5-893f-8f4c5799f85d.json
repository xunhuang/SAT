This choice correctly uses the relative pronoun &ldquo;that&rdquo; and no punctuation to create an integrated relative clause that provides essential information about the noun phrase (&ldquo;a book packaging company&rdquo;) that it modifies. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t use a relative pronoun to link the verb phrase beginning with &ldquo;specializes&rdquo; to the noun phrase that it modifies (&ldquo;a book packaging company&rdquo;).
