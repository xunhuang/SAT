  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences of the text establish that in California, houses were heated by building fires year-round. The underlined portion then indicates that the fires didn&rsquo;t merely provide physical warmth: they also represented being \"home\" and feeling protected. The underlined portion thus illustrates that a fire provides comfort beyond physical warmth.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn&rsquo;t summarize information that came before it. Whereas the previous two sentences describe fires&rsquo; ability to provide physical warmth to homes, the underlined portion focuses on the psychological comfort the fires offered. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text&rsquo;s second sentence mentions that fires were built in the summer because fog came in, which may have cooled the house, this detail isn&rsquo;t the focus of the underlined portion. Instead, the underlined portion indicates that fires were built for reasons beyond physical warmth: to create a sense of being home and safe. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion focuses on the emotional significance the author places on having a fire going inside the home. There is no indication that the author feels equally comfortable without a fire present.</p>",
