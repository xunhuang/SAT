Instead, the critics&rsquo; opinion offers additional emphasis in support of that claim. Choice D is incorrect because \"in other words\" illogically signals that the claim at the end of this sentence is merely paraphrasing the previous claim about the differences between the two editions. The critics&rsquo; opinion adds new information to the previous claim rather than simply paraphrasing it.</p>",
