  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence effectively begins a narrative about the creation of the robots, explaining that ants&rsquo; gap-crossing technique inspired Yasemin Ozkan-Aydin to \"set out to design\" robots that could collaborate in a similar manner.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes how the robots work together to cross gaps; it doesn&rsquo;t effectively begin a narrative about the creation of the robots. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence provides an overview of the steps Ozkan-Aydin took in creating the robots; it doesn&rsquo;t effectively begin a narrative about their creation. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence explains how ants form bridges; it doesn&rsquo;t effectively begin a narrative about the creation of the robots.</p>",
