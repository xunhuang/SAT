  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence uses \"unlike\" to emphasize a difference in how katydids and crab spiders use mimicry, noting that crab spiders use mimicry to ambush prey while katydids use it to hide from predators.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence does contrast katydids and crab spiders, it misrepresents the information in the notes. Katydids mimic the appearance of leaves (not flowers), whereas crab spiders mimic the appearance of flowers (not leaves). Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence indicates that katydids and crab spiders use mimicry, it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference in how they use it. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence describes what mimicry is; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference in how katydids and crab spiders specifically use mimicry.</p>",
