  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. &ldquo;In addition&rdquo; logically signals that the detail in this sentence&mdash;that Coleridge-Taylor included traditional African music in his classical compositions&mdash;adds to the information in the previous sentence. Specifically, the previous sentence indicates one way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry, and the claim that follows indicates a second, additional way. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because &ldquo;actually&rdquo; illogically signals that the detail in this sentence is surprising in light of the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the detail adds to the information, indicating a second, additional way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry. Choice C is incorrect because &ldquo;however&rdquo; illogically signals that the detail in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the detail adds to the information, indicating a second, additional way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry. Choice D is incorrect because &ldquo;regardless&rdquo; illogically signals that the detail in this sentence is true despite the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the detail adds to the information, indicating a second, additional way in which Coleridge-Taylor emphasized his mixed-race ancestry. </p>",
