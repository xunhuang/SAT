  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. This choice clearly states that <em>Yao Drum</em> was inspired by a ceremonial dance of the Yao people. This directly supports the curator&rsquo;s claim that some of Dai&rsquo;s pieces &ldquo;represent the dances of local communities&rdquo; she visited. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice discusses the sound and music in <em>Yao Drum</em>, but it doesn&rsquo;t connect these elements to &ldquo;the dances of local communities,&rdquo; which is the focus of the claim. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t mention the dances of local communities, but instead discusses how <em>Yao Drum</em> is different from some of Dai&rsquo;s earlier works. Choice D is incorrect. This choice describes the choreography of <em>Yao Drum</em>, but it doesn&rsquo;t connect these elements to &ldquo;the dances of local communities,&rdquo; which is the focus of the claim. </p>",
