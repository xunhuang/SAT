  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes how harsh the conditions in the tundra can be, noting that the winters are especially harsh and describing the average temperatures as &ldquo;frigid.&rdquo; </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the sentence explains that some animals can survive harsh tundra winters; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize how harsh the conditions can be. Choice C is incorrect because the sentence specifies how many different kinds of plants can live in the tundra; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize how harsh the conditions in the tundra can be. Choice D is incorrect because the sentence explains that both plants and animals can survive in the tundra; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize how harsh the conditions in the tundra can be. </p>",
