  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Octavia Butler&rsquo;s career. In this context, &ldquo;impenetrable&rdquo; means impossible to enter. The text indicates that the field of science fiction was dominated by white males when Butler, a Black woman, started writing, but she published several science fiction short stories and a novel and later won a prestigious award; that is, Butler pursued science fiction writing and had success. This context suggests that Butler didn&rsquo;t view the genre as impossible to enter. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; would mean genuinely good or valid. Nothing in the text suggests that Butler didn&rsquo;t think the science fiction genre was good or valid; in fact, it indicates that she pursued and made a successful career of publishing work in that field. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, &ldquo;compelling&rdquo; would mean attracting or demanding attention. The text indicates that Butler chose to write science fiction, so it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that she didn&rsquo;t see the field as drawing her attention. Choice D is incorrect. To say that Butler didn&rsquo;t consider science fiction &ldquo;indecipherable,&rdquo; or impossible to understand, would suggest that Butler did understand it. However, the text doesn&rsquo;t address Butler&rsquo;s ability to interpret works in the genre; rather, it focuses on Butler&rsquo;s successful pursuit of writing science fiction. </p>",
