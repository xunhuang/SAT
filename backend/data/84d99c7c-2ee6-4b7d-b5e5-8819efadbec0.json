  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence provides Acquah&rsquo;s quotation about pointillism&rsquo;s \"illusion of movement\" to explain that she used pointillism to create the illusion of movement in her painting of women dancing.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The sentence explains pointillism and indicates that Acquah used the technique in her painting, but it doesn&rsquo;t provide a quotation or explain why. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence provides a quotation from Acquah about pointillism, the quotation merely describes a specific aspect of the technique; the sentence doesn&rsquo;t explain why Acquah used pointillism in her painting. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence provides a quotation from Acquah, the quotation illustrates Acquah&rsquo;s views on Ghanaian women; the sentence doesn&rsquo;t explain why Acquah used pointillism in her painting.</p>",
