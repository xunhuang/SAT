  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice correctly uses a question mark to punctuate the interrogative sentence &ldquo;how are they able to move so fast?&rdquo; The interrogative sentence asks a direct question, and the next sentence answers it. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the context requires an interrogative sentence. The exclamative sentence &ldquo;how they are able to move so fast!&rdquo; emphasizes the penguin&rsquo;s high rate of speed, but it doesn&rsquo;t set up the next sentence&rsquo;s explanation of how the penguins achieve such speeds. Choice B is incorrect because a period can&rsquo;t be used in this way to punctuate an interrogative sentence. Choice C is incorrect because the context requires an interrogative sentence. The exclamative sentence &ldquo;how they are able to move so fast&rdquo; emphasizes the penguin&rsquo;s high rate of speed, but it doesn&rsquo;t set up the next sentence&rsquo;s explanation of how the penguins achieve such speeds.\n&nbsp;</p>",
