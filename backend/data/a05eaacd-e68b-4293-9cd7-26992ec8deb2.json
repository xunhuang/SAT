  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. Females only traveled 9.28 km per day in the cold-dry season, versus 12.64 and 12.48 km per day in the monsoon and hot-dry seasons, respectively. Males only traveled 15.81 km per day per day in the cold-dry season, versus 18.93 and 18.87 km per day in the monsoon and hot-dry seasons, respectively. So, the cold-dry season was the season where both males and females had the least daily travel. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although females traveled least in the cold-dry season, males didn&rsquo;t travel least in the hot-dry season. Instead, they traveled less per day in the cold-dry season as well. Choice C is incorrect. Females had less daily travel in the cold-dry season than in the hot-dry season (9.28 versus 12.48 km per day), and males had less daily travel in the cold-dry season than in the monsoon season (15.81 versus 18.93 km per day). Choice D is incorrect. In fact, both females and males traveled the most kilometers per day in the monsoon season. </p>",
