The modifier &ldquo;far from being modern inventions&rdquo; must be describing &ldquo;drinking straws,&rdquo; because those are the only possible inventions in this sentence. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier &ldquo;far from being modern inventions&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be describing &ldquo;Sumerians,&rdquo; because they are a group of people, not an invention. Choice C is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier &ldquo;far from being modern inventions&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be describing &ldquo;the use of drinking straws,&rdquo; because it is not &ldquo;the use&rdquo; of drinking straws that is an invention&mdash;it is the drinking straws themselves.

The modifier &ldquo;far from being modern inventions&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be describing &ldquo;Ancient Mesopotamia,&rdquo; because that is a place, not an invention. </p>",
