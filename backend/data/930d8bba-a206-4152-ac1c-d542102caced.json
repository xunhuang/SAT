  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period after &ldquo;percent&rdquo; is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (&ldquo;After&hellip;percent&rdquo;) and another (&ldquo;Such&hellip;up&rdquo;). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join sentences.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (&ldquo;After&hellip;percent&rdquo; and &ldquo;Such&hellip;up&rdquo;) are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. </p>",
