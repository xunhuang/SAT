  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (&ldquo;However...earlier&rdquo;) and another (&ldquo;In...area&rdquo;). The supplementary phrase &ldquo;in 1420 CE&rdquo; modifies &ldquo;humans,&rdquo; the subject of the third sentence. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Moreover, the subordinating conjunction &ldquo;which&rdquo; creates a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests that the supplementary phrase beginning with &ldquo;in&rdquo; modifies the previous information (&ldquo;However...earlier&rdquo;) rather than the information that follows.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (&ldquo;However...earlier&rdquo; and &ldquo;in...area&rdquo;) are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. </p>",
