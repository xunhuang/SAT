  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes how far the infantrymen traveled, indicating that they rode their bicycles from Montana to Missouri, a total of 1,900 miles.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the sentence mentions when the anniversary of the journey occurred; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize how far the infantrymen traveled. Choice C is incorrect because the sentence discusses the goal of the journey; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize how far the infantrymen traveled. Choice D is incorrect because the sentence notes that Cede&ntilde;o honored the infantrymen by reenacting their journey; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize how far the infantrymen traveled.</p>",
