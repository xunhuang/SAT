It lists some of his works but doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between those he wrote in Jamaica and those he wrote in Harlem. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t emphasize McKay&rsquo;s accomplishments before moving to Harlem. It only mentions the year he moved and what he would become known for afterwards. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t emphasize McKay&rsquo;s accomplishments before moving to Harlem. It mentions that he lived in Jamaica, but it doesn&rsquo;t name any of the works he published there. </p>",
