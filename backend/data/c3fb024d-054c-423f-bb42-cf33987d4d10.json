  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence recounts the sequence of events proposed by the researchers: a large moon orbiting Saturn came close enough to the planet that it was broken apart by tidal forces, and the resulting debris formed Saturn&rsquo;s rings.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the sentence misrepresents information from the notes; according to the notes, tidal forces, not debris, caused the moon to break apart. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence offers information relevant to the 2022 study but doesn&rsquo;t recount the sequence of events proposed by the researchers. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence recounts a sequence, but it&rsquo;s a sequence of the researchers&rsquo; activities, not the sequence of events proposed by the researchers.</p>",
