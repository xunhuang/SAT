  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (&ldquo;In 2017...<em>Nutcracker</em>&rdquo;) and another (&ldquo;According...culture&rdquo;). The supplementary element &ldquo;according to reviewers&rdquo; modifies the main clause of the second sentence (&ldquo;the Toledos&rsquo;...culture&rdquo;). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Furthermore, no punctuation is needed within the supplementary element &ldquo;according to reviewers.&rdquo; Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. </p>",
