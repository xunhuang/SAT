  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice correctly uses a question mark to punctuate the interrogative clause &ldquo;could the blueberries thrive,&rdquo; which asks a direct question at the end of the sentence. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a period can&rsquo;t be used in this way to punctuate an interrogative clause, such as &ldquo;could the blueberries thrive,&rdquo; at the end of a sentence. Choice B is incorrect because the context requires an interrogative clause. The declarative clause &ldquo;the blueberries could thrive&rdquo; incorrectly indicates that it was known that the blueberries could thrive in alkaline soil, whereas Michel had yet to find this out. Choice C is incorrect because a question mark can&rsquo;t be used in this way to punctuate a declarative clause, such as &ldquo;the blueberries could thrive,&rdquo; at the end of a sentence. </p>",
