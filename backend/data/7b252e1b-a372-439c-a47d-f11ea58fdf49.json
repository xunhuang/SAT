  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice uses a semicolon in a conventional way to join the first main clause (&ldquo;In 2004&hellip;sampler&rdquo;) and the second main clause (&ldquo;in 2014&hellip;pillars&rdquo;). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two main clauses. The word &ldquo;later&rdquo; is an adverb and cannot be used to join two main clauses unless it is preceded by a conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two main clauses. The word &ldquo;later&rdquo; is an adverb and cannot be used to join two main clauses unless it is preceded by a conjunction. </p>",
