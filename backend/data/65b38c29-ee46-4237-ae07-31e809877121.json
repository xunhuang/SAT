  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (\"In&hellip;<em>Panchali</em>\") and another (\"A quiet&hellip;time\"). The phrase beginning with \"a quiet\" modifies the subject of the next sentence, \"Ray&rsquo;s film.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences.</p>",
