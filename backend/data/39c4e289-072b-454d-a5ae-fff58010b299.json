  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement, providing an example of how the people of the Navajo Nation can experience different climate conditions depending on where they live. The table shows the average highest temperatures and average lowest temperatures in four locations in the Navajo Nation in July. According to the table, Ramah&rsquo;s average highest temperature for July was 83&deg;, whereas Cameron&rsquo;s average highest temperature was much higher, at 99&deg;. This difference illustrates the statement that the people of the Navajo Nation can experience different climate conditions depending on where they live. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it states that Cameron and Teec Nos Pos had the same average lowest temperature (65&deg;) for July, which suggests a similarity in climate conditions in those locations rather than a difference. Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents the data from the table, which shows that the average highest temperature in July for Tuba City was 83&deg;, not 94&deg;, and for Teec Nos Pos it was 94&deg;, not 93&deg;. Even if the cited data accurately reflected the data in the table, the similarity between the two values for average highest temperature would suggest that people in the two locations likely experience similar climate conditions, not different climate conditions. Choice D is incorrect because it states that Ramah and Tuba City had the same average lowest temperature (50&deg;) for July, which suggests a similarity in climate conditions in those locations rather than a difference. </p>",
