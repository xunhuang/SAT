  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. \"Therefore\" logically signals that the action described in this sentence&mdash;the researchers theorizing that the dish was named for its effect on diners&mdash;is a result or consequence of the previous observation that the dish had a calming effect.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because \"alternately\" illogically signals that the action described in this sentence offers an alternative or contrast to the previous observation that the dish had a calming effect. Instead, the action is a result or consequence of that observation. Choice C is incorrect because \"nevertheless\" illogically signals that the action described in this sentence occurs despite the previous observation that the dish had a calming effect. Instead, the action is a result or consequence of that observation. Choice D is incorrect because \"likewise\" illogically signals that this sentence merely adds a second, similar detail to the previous observation that the dish had a calming effect. Instead, this sentence describes an action that is a result or consequence of that observation.</p>",
