  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. Noting the time frame of the US Civil War and the fact that Amos enlisted during this time frame, the sentence emphasizes that Amos&rsquo;s enlistment date places him among the historically significant group of US Navy sailors of Filipino descent who served during the Civil War.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence identifies Amos and Ignases and notes that Amos&rsquo;s enlistment date was later than Ignases&rsquo;s; the sentence doesn&rsquo;t explain the historical significance of the date. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence identifies Amos and Ignases as US Navy sailors of Filipino descent, noting Ignases&rsquo;s birth year; the sentence doesn&rsquo;t provide Amos&rsquo;s enlistment date or its historical significance. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence provides Amos&rsquo;s enlistment date and mentions that he served alongside a sailor of Filipino descent; it doesn&rsquo;t explain the historical significance of the date.</p>",
