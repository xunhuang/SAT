Study participants who self-reported using either an Affect Mode or Role Mode&mdash;which prioritize choices that have a stronger positive emotional or social impact, respectively&mdash;were more likely to select a green plan. Conversely, participants using a Calculation Mode&mdash;which aims to minimize both financial cost and personal inconvenience&mdash;were more likely to select a standard plan, even when the green option was cheaper.

  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the influence of decision-making modes on consumers&rsquo; choices of different electricity plans. The Affect Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker&rsquo;s social motivations, and the Calculation Mode describes choices based on minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience. Thus, if those using a Calculation Mode disfavor the green plan, it would be due to some financial or convenience burden the green plan imposes that the other doesn&rsquo;t. The text indicates that the green plan had a lower financial cost but was nonetheless rejected by participants using the Calculation Mode. It therefore follows that the green plan likely imposed a convenience burden that outweighed potential financial savings for these participants.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience. Thus, unlike the Affect or Role Modes, the Calculation Mode would almost certainly involve taking price differences into account. Choice B is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience. Thus, there is no reason to think that participants using the Calculation Mode at any point took social responsibility into account, let alone think that they discovered a disparity between their expectations and reality. Choice D is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience. Thus, the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that cost-effectiveness is a factor for participants using the Affect or Role Modes, and there is no basis to compare their beliefs in the truthfulness of the green-plan description with those of the Calculation Mode users.</p>",
