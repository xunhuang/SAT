  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of independent clauses within a sentence. An independent clause is a phrase containing a subject and a verb that can stand on its own as a sentence. This choice uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction &ldquo;but&rdquo; to join the first independent clause (&ldquo;underlines&hellip;lower a book&rsquo;s value&rdquo;) and the second independent clause (&ldquo;such markings&hellip;can be a gold mine to scholars&rdquo;) to create a compound sentence. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because&nbsp;it results in a run-on sentence. The two independent clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice.&nbsp;A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between two independent clauses. Choice D is incorrect because&nbsp;a comma is needed to mark the boundary between two coordinated independent clauses. </p>",
