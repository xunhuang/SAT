In the first half of the text, the speaker describes our attempts to control nature: cultivating, taming, and irrigating different kinds of land. In the second half, the speaker states that we can never tame the sea or the beach.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t describe the overall structure of the text. The speaker never argues that we should not interfere with nature. Rather, the speaker says that we are able to tame many different kinds of land, but we are unable to tame the sea or beaches.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t describe the overall structure of the text. The speaker never describes our cultivation, taming, and irrigation of land as &ldquo;temporary.&rdquo; Rather, the speaker says that we are able to tame many different kinds of land, but we are unable to tame the sea or beaches.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t describe the overall structure of the text. The speaker never describes our cultivation, taming, and irrigation of land as an &ldquo;admirable&rdquo; approach to nature.&rdquo; Rather, the speaker says that we are able to tame many different kinds of land, but we are unable to tame the sea or beaches.&nbsp;</p>",
