  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma and a coordinating conjunction (\"but\") to join the first main clause (\"Leibniz...century\") and the second main clause (\"these ingenious...calculators\").</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice D is incorrect because joining the two main clauses in this way with the subordinating conjunction \"that\" results in an ungrammatical and illogical sentence.</p>",
