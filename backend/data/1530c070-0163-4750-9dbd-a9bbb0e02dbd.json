  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the kinds of mammals alive during the Mesozoic era. As used in this context, &ldquo;diverse&rdquo; means to have a significant amount of variety. The text indicates that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals can&rsquo;t be characterized in a certain way, then contrasts the view put forward by those scientists with Luo&rsquo;s research, which shows that Mesozoic mammals &ldquo;weren&rsquo;t all ground-dwelling insectivores&rdquo; and instead were &ldquo;various.&rdquo; This context suggests that some scientists have viewed Mesozoic mammals as being all alike, or not a very diverse group.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren&rsquo;t very &ldquo;predatory,&rdquo; or that they didn&rsquo;t prey on other animals, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo&rsquo;s research showing that Mesozoic mammals &ldquo;weren&rsquo;t all ground-dwelling insectivores.&rdquo; This context suggests that some scientists have regarded Mesozoic mammals as all being insectivores, or animals that prey on insects, not that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals didn&rsquo;t prey on other animals.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren&rsquo;t very &ldquo;obscure,&rdquo; or concealed or not well known, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo&rsquo;s research showing that Mesozoic mammals were a varied group. There&rsquo;s no contrast between saying that the mammals weren&rsquo;t concealed or well known and the mammals being varied. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren&rsquo;t very &ldquo;localized,&rdquo; or confined to a particular area, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo&rsquo;s research showing that Mesozoic mammals were a varied group. There&rsquo;s no contrast between saying that the mammals weren&rsquo;t localized and the mammals being varied. Although the text mentions mammal fossils found in China, nothing in the discussion of Luo&rsquo;s research addresses the limits of Mesozoic mammal habitats.&nbsp;</p>",
