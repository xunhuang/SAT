  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. Faure redesigned the battery in 1881, and the original battery was invented &ldquo;fifteen years earlier.&rdquo; Notice that this is the only choice in the past tense. To indicate that a past occurrence took place before another past occurrence, we need to use &ldquo;had&rdquo; + the past tense form of the verb. This is called the &ldquo;past perfect&rdquo; tense. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a tense error. Plant&eacute; invented the original battery in the past, so we shouldn&rsquo;t use the present tense &ldquo;is inventing.&rdquo; Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a tense error. Plant&eacute; invented the original battery in the past, so we shouldn&rsquo;t use the future tense &ldquo;will invent.&rdquo; Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a tense error. Plant&eacute; invented the original battery in the past, so we shouldn&rsquo;t use the present tense &ldquo;invents.&rdquo; </p>",
