This choice correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction \"but\" to join the first main clause (\"Scientists...time\") and the second main clause (\"the Lund...otherwise\").</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it&rsquo;s conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.</p>",
