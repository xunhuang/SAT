  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence uses a quotation from Guirguis to explain what <em>Here I Have Returned</em> represents, noting that Guirguis said the sculpture symbolizes \"women who have lifted and supported Egyptian society and culture.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence explains what Guirguis says she wants her work to achieve and provides an example of her work; it doesn&rsquo;t use a quotation to explain what the sculpture represents. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence mentions the instrument whose shape inspired the sculpture but doesn&rsquo;t use a quotation to explain what the sculpture represents. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence does use a quotation from Guirguis, the quotation explains what she hopes her works in general achieve, not what the sculpture in particular represents.</p>",
