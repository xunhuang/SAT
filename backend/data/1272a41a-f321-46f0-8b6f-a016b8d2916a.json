  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period after &ldquo;walls&rdquo; is used correctly to mark the boundary between the first sentence (&ldquo;In...walls&rdquo;) and the second sentence (&ldquo;With&hellip;techniques&rdquo;), which starts with a supplementary phrase. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (&ldquo;In...walls&rdquo; and &ldquo;with...paintings&rdquo;) are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice C is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction &ldquo;so&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join sentences. </p>",
