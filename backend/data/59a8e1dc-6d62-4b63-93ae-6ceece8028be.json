  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense. In this choice, the simple past tense verb &ldquo;suggested&rdquo; properly indicates that Zufall offered her suggestion for the product&rsquo;s name in the past. This verb tense is consistent with the previous sentence&rsquo;s use of a simple past tense verb (&ldquo;advised&rdquo;) to describe Zufall&rsquo;s advice to McVicker in the 1950s. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the present tense verb &ldquo;suggests&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t indicate that Zufall offered her suggestion in the past.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the past perfect verb &ldquo;had suggested&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t consistent with the previous sentence&rsquo;s use of the simple past tense verb &ldquo;advised&rdquo; to describe Zufall&rsquo;s advice to McVicker. Choice D is incorrect because the past progressive verb &ldquo;was suggesting&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t consistent with the previous sentence&rsquo;s use of the simple past tense verb &ldquo;advised&rdquo; to describe Zufall&rsquo;s advice to McVicker.&nbsp;</p>",
