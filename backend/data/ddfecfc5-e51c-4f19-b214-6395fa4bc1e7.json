  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. &ldquo;Specifically&rdquo; logically signals that the information in this sentence about Sauer&rsquo;s argument&mdash;that, according to Sauer, cultures play a role in their own development, as opposed to being shaped solely by natural surroundings&mdash;provides specific, precise details elaborating on the more general information in the previous sentence about how Sauer challenged prevailing views about how natural landscapes influence human cultures. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because &ldquo;similarly&rdquo; illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Sauer&rsquo;s argument is similar to, but separate from, the more general information in the previous sentence. Instead, it provides specific, precise details elaborating on that information. Choice B is incorrect because &ldquo;finally&rdquo; illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Sauer&rsquo;s argument indicates a last step in a process or a concluding summary.
