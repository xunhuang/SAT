  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence effectively introduces the poetry collection <em>Precario/Precarious</em>, noting that it is a collection by Vicu&ntilde;a that was published in 1983 by Tanam Press.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the 1983 poetry collection <em>Precario/Precarious</em>, it focuses mainly on Vicu&ntilde;a&rsquo;s visual art. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence doesn&rsquo;t introduce the 1983 poetry collection <em>Precario/Precarious</em>; instead, it introduces Vicu&ntilde;a. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes the location of Vicu&ntilde;a&rsquo;s 1971 exhibition <em>Pinturas, poemas y explicaciones</em>; it doesn&rsquo;t introduce the 1983 poetry collection <em>Precario/Precarious</em><em>.</em></p>",
