  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. A main clause requires a finite (tensed) verb to perform the action of the subject (in this case, \"yellow\"), and this choice supplies the present tense verb \"is considered\" to indicate that yellow is considered a complementary color to blue in modern color theory.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle \"having been considered\" doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice C is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive \"to be considered\" doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice D is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle \"being considered\" doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb.</p>",
