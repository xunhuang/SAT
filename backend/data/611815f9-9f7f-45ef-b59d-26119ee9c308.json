  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Ana Castillo&rsquo;s 1986 novel <em>The Mixquiahuala Letters</em>. The text states that the novel consists entirely of letters from the narrator to her friend&mdash;a format that some students reading the novel in a class found intimidating. According to the text, those students also found the novel&rsquo;s treatment of gender to be old-fashioned. In response to the students&rsquo; concerns, their professor emphasized the novel&rsquo;s relevance: it&rsquo;s written in modern-sounding language and addresses issues that still matter. This, in turn, suggests that <em>The Mixquiahuala Letters</em> is more relevant to contemporary audiences than it may initially seem. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the professor&rsquo;s response to the students only mentions <em>The Mixquiahuala Letters</em>: it doesn&rsquo;t compare the novel to others from the same period. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the professor&rsquo;s response to the students compares <em>The Mixquiahuala Letters</em> to contemporary novels about friendship. Choice D is incorrect because the professor&rsquo;s response to the students doesn&rsquo;t address the idea of reading the novel&rsquo;s letters multiple times and in different orders. </p>",

As they began reading it in class, some students remarked that they found the novel&rsquo;s letter format daunting and its treatment of gender relations old-fashioned.
