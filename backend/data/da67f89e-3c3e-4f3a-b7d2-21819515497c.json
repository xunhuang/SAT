  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a difference between C-type and S-type asteroids, noting that C-type asteroids are mainly composed of carbon, while S-type asteroids are mainly composed of silicate minerals. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence states that C-type and S-type are two types of asteroids, but it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between them. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t directly mention C-type or S-type asteroids.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions that 17 percent of known asteroids are S-type asteroids, it doesn&rsquo;t identify the percentage of asteroids that are C-type. Therefore, the sentence doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between the two types. </p>",
