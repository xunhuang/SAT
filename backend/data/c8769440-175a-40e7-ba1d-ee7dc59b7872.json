  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. &ldquo;As a result&rdquo; indicates that water molecules maintaining their linked structure at high pressures is caused by the strengthening of these water molecules by trimethylamine N-oxide. So the transition &ldquo;as a result&rdquo; fits the context perfectly. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn&rsquo;t disagree with the previous one&mdash;rather, it&rsquo;s describing an effect of the phenomenon described in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn&rsquo;t disagree with the previous one; it actually expands on the previous sentence by describing an effect of the strengthened molecules. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense here. The second sentence doesn&rsquo;t provide an example or instance of the idea in the previous sentence. Instead, it explores the effects of the previous idea in more depth. </p>",
