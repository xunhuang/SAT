It doesn&rsquo;t demonstrate that the tadpoles in the high-density pond produced more bufadienolide overall. The fact that they didn&rsquo;t produce more kinds of bufadienolide isn&rsquo;t relevant to the conclusion. </p>",

The researchers tested <em>B. bufo </em>tadpoles&rsquo; responses to different levels of competition by creating ponds with different tadpole population densities but a fixed amount of food. Based on analysis of the tadpoles after three weeks, the researchers concluded that increased competition drove bufadienolide production at the expense of growth.</p>",
