In a review of the Broadway production, theater critic Jesse Green enthusiastically praised the musical&rsquo;s storytelling. However, Green also explained that he had seen the earlier version of <em>Hadestown </em>in 2016 and had found the storytelling to be very confusing.

  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of critic Jesse Green&rsquo;s review of the 2016 and 2019 productions of <em>Hadestown</em>. The text states that Green found the storytelling in the 2016 off-Broadway version to be \"very confusing\" but that he \"enthusiastically praised\" the storytelling in the revised 2019 Broadway version. This stark contrast in Green&rsquo;s opinions suggests that he believed the musical had significantly improved between 2016 and its 2019 Broadway premiere.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it contradicts the information in the text. The text indicates that Green found the storytelling in the 2016 version to be \"very confusing,\" while he \"enthusiastically praised\" the storytelling in the 2019 version. This suggests that the 2019 version had fewer, not more, storytelling problems. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t provide any information about Green&rsquo;s opinion on the size of the 2019 Broadway production. While it mentions that the 2019 production was larger than the 2016 production, there&rsquo;s no indication in the text that Green thought the 2019 production should have been even larger than it was. Choice C is incorrect because it contradicts the information in the text. The text&rsquo;s description of Green&rsquo;s enthusiastic praise for the 2019 production suggests that he found this version more enjoyable, not less enjoyable, than the 2016 version, which he described as \"very confusing.\"</p>",
