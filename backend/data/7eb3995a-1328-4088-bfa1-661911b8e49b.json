  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The claim we&rsquo;re trying to prove is that guilds were much more numerous relative to population in some cities than others. This choice describes the guilds per number of inhabitants in two cities (Rouen and Paris), showing significant differences between guilds relative to population in these cities.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Bordeaux had 80,000 inhabitants, according to the table, while Lyon had 143,000, so it isn&rsquo;t correct to say that they had \"nearly equal numbers of inhabitants.\" Lyon had almost twice as many inhabitants. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Although Lyon did have fewer inhabitants than Paris, it didn&rsquo;t have more guilds&mdash;Paris had 133 guilds versus Lyon&rsquo;s 72. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t support the claim. To show that guilds were more numerous relative to population in some cities than others, we would need to compare at least two cities, and this choice only mentions one.</p>",
