  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence compares the two women&rsquo;s contributions to the march: Hedgeman worked behind the scenes to make sure a woman speaker was included, whereas Bates actually spoke at the event.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While it acknowledges that the two women both contributed to the march, it doesn&rsquo;t indicate what Hedgeman did, so no comparison is made. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence provides information about the two women, it doesn&rsquo;t mention anything about Bates&rsquo;s contribution to the march.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence indicates that the two women both fought for civil rights, it doesn&rsquo;t compare their individual contributions to the march. </p>",
