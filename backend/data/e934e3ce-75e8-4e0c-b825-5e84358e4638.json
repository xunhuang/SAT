  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes the order in which two of Jordan Bennett&rsquo;s exhibitions were held, indicating that <em>Wije&rsquo;wi</em> took place in 2017 and <em>Ketu&rsquo;elmita&rsquo;jik</em> took place a year later (2018). </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence mentions that exhibitions of Jordan Bennett&rsquo;s paintings took place in 2017 and 2018, it doesn&rsquo;t identify the exhibitions or emphasize the order in which they were held. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions two of Jordan Bennett&rsquo;s exhibitions<em>,</em>&nbsp;it doesn&rsquo;t indicate the order in which they were held. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence mentions two of Jordan Bennett&rsquo;s exhibitions and specifies when one of them was held, it doesn&rsquo;t state when the exhibition at the Grenfell Art Gallery occurred. Thus, the order in which the two exhibitions were held isn&rsquo;t clearly established in the sentence.&nbsp;</p>",
