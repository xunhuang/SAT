This choice most effectively emphasizes \"a similarity\" by identifying a trait the works share: \"both Erasure and Home Grown include discarded objects.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t \"emphasize a similarity.\" Instead, this choice shows how the materials used in the two works are different. Notice the use of the contrast word \"however.\" Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t \"emphasize a similarity between the two works.\" While it says that Tubbs&rsquo;s work \"often features discarded objects,\" it doesn&rsquo;t provide details about the two works in question. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t \"emphasize a similarity.\" Instead, this choice shows how the works were produced at different times.</p>",
