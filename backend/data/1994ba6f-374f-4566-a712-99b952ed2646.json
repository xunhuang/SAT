This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the subordinate clause (&ldquo;While&hellip;lifelike&rdquo;) and the main clause (&ldquo;others look to the past&rdquo;). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in an incomplete sentence with no main clause. Choice B is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the subordinate clause (&ldquo;While&hellip;lifelike&rdquo;) and the main clause (&ldquo;others&hellip;past&rdquo;).
