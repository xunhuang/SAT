While the sentence describes one of the metrics the study assessed, it doesn&rsquo;t present any of the study&rsquo;s findings. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence compares specific findings about two of the languages studied, it doesn&rsquo;t provide an overview of the study&rsquo;s findings across all 17 languages. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence compares specific findings about two of the languages studied; it doesn&rsquo;t provide an overview of the study&rsquo;s findings across all 17 languages.
