  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested here is punctuation between a verb and object. No punctuation is needed between the verb (\"appreciate\") and its object (\"the multiple references...\"). The object helps complete the idea of the verb&mdash;in this case, it explains what fans of science fiction will appreciate&mdash;and any punctuation between the two results in an ungrammatical sentence.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the verb and its object. Choice C is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the verb and its object. Choice D is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the verb and its object.</p>",
