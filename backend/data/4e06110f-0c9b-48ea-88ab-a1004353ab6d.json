  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The text describes how Miranda circulated, edited, and added footnotes to &ldquo;Letter to the Spanish Americans,&rdquo; and it claims that the letter and its author would have &ldquo;remained insignificant&rdquo; if it weren&rsquo;t for Miranda&rsquo;s efforts. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text only says that Viscardo wrote the letter and that Miranda edited it: it never suggests that the original authorship of the letter is up for debate. Choice B is incorrect. This contradicts the text. The text says that Miranda edited and footnoted the letter, but it identifies Viscardo as the letter&rsquo;s author. It also never identifies certain arguments as more eloquent than others. Choice D is incorrect. This is outside the scope of the text. The paragraph describes Miranda&rsquo;s role in the creation and distribution of the letter, but it doesn&rsquo;t get into the effects of the letter on other people. </p>",

  "stimulus": "<p>Having written the impassioned call to arms &ldquo;Letter to the Spanish Americans&rdquo; in 1791, Peruvian intellectual Juan Pablo Viscardo y Guzm&aacute;n is often considered a forerunner for the independence movements in Latin America. But Viscardo&rsquo;s role in history would have remained insignificant were it not for Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda, who was handed the unpublished letter after Viscardo&rsquo;s death. Miranda not only helped circulate the letter, but his edits and footnotes to the text position Miranda as a central figure in the text&rsquo;s creation.</p>",
