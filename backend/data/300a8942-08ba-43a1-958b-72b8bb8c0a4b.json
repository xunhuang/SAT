  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the author&rsquo;s claim about the relationship between Neanderthals and <em>Homo sapiens</em>. As used in this context, &ldquo;tenuous&rdquo; means lacking substance. The end of the first sentence states that the author&rsquo;s claim didn&rsquo;t consider certain key pieces of evidence&mdash;&ldquo;recent archaeological discoveries&rdquo;&mdash;and is therefore weak. &nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context to refer to the author&rsquo;s claim as &ldquo;disorienting,&rdquo; or confusing. The text suggests that the author&rsquo;s claim is insubstantial, not that it&rsquo;s difficult to grasp. Choice C is incorrect because referring to the claim as &ldquo;nuanced,&rdquo; or subtle, wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. According to the text, the claim is incomplete because it didn&rsquo;t consider certain key information about recent archaeological finds; it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that what&rsquo;s in the claim lacks precision. Choice D is incorrect because saying that the claim is &ldquo;unoriginal,&rdquo; or imitative, wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. The text faults the claim because it doesn&rsquo;t consider certain key information about recent archaeological finds; it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the author&rsquo;s claim lacks originality. </p>",
