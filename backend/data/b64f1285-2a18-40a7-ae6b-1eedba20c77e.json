Choice C is incorrect because the present tense verb \"is\" doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the claim about Los Angeles&rsquo;s population refers to the population back in the 1860s. Choice D is incorrect because the future tense verb \"will be\" doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the claim about Los Angeles&rsquo;s population refers to the population back in the 1860s.</p>",
