This choice correctly uses a period to punctuate a declarative sentence (\"the reed of a wind instrument is the mouthpiece\") that ends with a prepositional phrase (\"where sound is made\").</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. It&rsquo;s unconventional to use a question mark to punctuate a declarative sentence. Choice B is incorrect. The structure requires that the sentence continue as a declarative clause, not end with an interrogative clause. Choice D is incorrect. The structure requires that the sentence continue as a declarative clause and end with a period, not end with an interrogative clause and a question mark.</p>",
