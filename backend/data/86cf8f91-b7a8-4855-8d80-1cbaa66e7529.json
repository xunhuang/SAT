  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The clause &ldquo;A subseasonal&hellip;advance&rdquo; and the clause &ldquo;its predictions&hellip;forecast&rdquo; are both independent clauses, so using a semicolon to separate them is grammatically correct.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause &ldquo;A subseasonal&hellip;advance&rdquo; and the clause &ldquo;its predictions&hellip;forecast&rdquo; are both independent clauses, so a comma is not enough to separate them.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause &ldquo;A subseasonal&hellip;advance&rdquo; and the clause &ldquo;its predictions&hellip;forecast&rdquo; are both independent clauses, so they need to be separated with specific punctuation (a period, a semi-colon, a colon, a dash, or a comma + a coordinating conjunction).&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause &ldquo;A subseasonal&hellip;advance&rdquo; and the clause &ldquo;its predictions&hellip;forecast&rdquo; are both independent clauses, so the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; by itself is not enough to separate them. There would need to be a comma before &ldquo;and&rdquo; for this choice to work.&nbsp;</p>",
