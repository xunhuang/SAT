  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (&ldquo;Defying&hellip;fast&rdquo;) and another sentence that begins with a supplementary phrase (&ldquo;During&hellip;Olympics&rdquo;). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. When a dash is present in a sentence (&ldquo;ran&mdash;fast&rdquo;), it&rsquo;s not conventional to use another dash (&ldquo;fast&mdash;during&rdquo;) to mark the boundary between sentences because it creates a potentially confusing sentence. In this context, a period, semicolon, or colon would be clear and more conventional. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (&ldquo;Defying&hellip;fast&rdquo;) and (&ldquo;during&hellip;Olympics&rdquo;) are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. </p>",
