  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period after &ldquo;tombs&rdquo; is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (&ldquo;Archaeologist...tombs&rdquo;) and another (&ldquo;Built...nature&rdquo;). </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice C is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join the two sentences. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (&ldquo;Archaeologist...tombs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Built...nature&rdquo;) are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. </p>",
