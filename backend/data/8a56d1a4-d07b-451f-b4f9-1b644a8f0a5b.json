  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence places Einstein&rsquo;s argument within the historical context of the development of quantum theory, noting that his argument&mdash;made during the dawn of the field&mdash;conflicted with Bohr&rsquo;s argument, which became the widely accepted view.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The sentence misrepresents information from the notes, attributing the argument that electrons had a reality independent of observation to Bohr, not Einstein. In addition, while the sentence provides the date of the conference, it doesn&rsquo;t place Einstein&rsquo;s argument in the context of the development of quantum theory. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence indicates that Einstein attended the 1927 Solvay Conference; it doesn&rsquo;t identify Einstein&rsquo;s argument or place it in the historical context of the development of quantum theory. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence explains that Einstein and Bohr had a famous debate in 1927 and that Bohr&rsquo;s argument remained popular decades afterward; it doesn&rsquo;t identify Einstein&rsquo;s argument or place it in the context of the development of quantum theory.</p>",
