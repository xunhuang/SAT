  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence explains an advantage of microprobes, noting that because microprobes weigh as little as 50 milligrams, they can explore areas inaccessible to rovers. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence indicates that rovers can land successfully on Mars despite their weight; it doesn&rsquo;t explain an advantage of microprobes. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions that microprobes have been proposed as an alternative to rovers, it doesn&rsquo;t explain an advantage of microprobes. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes a similarity between microprobes and rovers; it doesn&rsquo;t explain an advantage of microprobes. </p>",
