  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"soft\" most nearly means gentle. The text portrays Alice speaking about the snow falling against the window, describing it as sounding \"nice\" and similar to someone \"kissing the window.\" These details most strongly suggest that Alice thinks the sound made by the snow falling against the window is gentle.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"gentle\" can mean sensitive, or caring about others&rsquo; feelings, that isn&rsquo;t the meaning in this context; it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to say that Alice thinks the sound of the snow cares about anything. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is shapeless, or lacks a definite shape; she isn&rsquo;t indicating how anything looks or feels but, rather, is describing how \"nice\" and gentle the snow sounds. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is bland, or uninteresting; rather, she notices the sound and comments on how \"nice\" it is.</p>",
