Choice B is incorrect because &ldquo;admittedly&rdquo; illogically signals that the claim about sensory experience that follows is an exception to Aristotle&rsquo;s theory from earlier in the sentence. Instead, this claim is a restatement of his theory. Choice D is incorrect because &ldquo;meanwhile&rdquo; illogically signals that the claim about sensory experience that follows is separate from (while occurring simultaneously with) Aristotle&rsquo;s theory from earlier in the sentence.
