  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of novelist Leon Forrest&rsquo;s admiration of William Faulkner&rsquo;s writing style. In this context, \"imitation\" means something that resembles or reproduces something else. The text states that Forrest admired Faulkner&rsquo;s style and that anyone familiar with Faulkner&rsquo;s style would be able to see the stylistic similarities between a particular passage in Forrest&rsquo;s novel <em>Divine Days</em> and Faulkner&rsquo;s writing, a fact that supports the idea that Forrest&rsquo;s novel pays tribute to Faulkner by reproducing, or imitating, Faulkner&rsquo;s style.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, a \"forgetting\" would mean an instance in which something is overlooked or not remembered. The text emphasizes Forrest&rsquo;s admiration for Faulkner&rsquo;s style and the fact that Forrest&rsquo;s writing in some instances closely resembles Faulkner&rsquo;s stylistically. It therefore wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that in trying to pay tribute to Faulkner&rsquo;s style, Forrest failed to remember it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, a \"rejection\" would mean a dismissal of something as unworthy. The text emphasizes Forrest&rsquo;s admiration for Faulkner&rsquo;s writing style, stating that parts of Forrest&rsquo;s writings indicate efforts to copy that style. It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense therefore to suggest that Forrest had rejected or dismissed Faulkner&rsquo;s style as unworthy. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, an \"opinion\" would mean a view or judgment. Although the text focuses on Forrest&rsquo;s admiration of Faulkner, which suggests that Forrest had formed a positive judgment of Faulkner&rsquo;s style, the word opinion wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in this sentence: the sentence doesn&rsquo;t say that the passage from Forrest&rsquo;s novel expresses his view of Faulkner&rsquo;s style; rather, it suggests that stylistically, the passage closely resembles, or imitates, Faulkner&rsquo;s writing.</p>",
