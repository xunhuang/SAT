  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. Author 1 describes the puzzle that physicists still can&rsquo;t solve: at a microscopic level, the &ldquo;laws of physics&rdquo; suggest that we should be able to reverse processes that are not reversible at a macroscopic level (and, maybe, turn back time!). The experiment confirmed that those processes are not reversible even on the microscopic level, but it didn&rsquo;t explain why. This supports Author 1&rsquo;s point that physicists still don&rsquo;t fully understand how things work at a microscopic level&mdash;maybe the laws need to be revised. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. We can&rsquo;t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Text 2 does name two of the physicists involved in the experiment, but it never suggests that they disagree on anything. Choice C is incorrect. This is the opposite of what the experiment suggests. The experiment confirmed that the macroscopic-level law (&ldquo;these things can&rsquo;t be reversed&mdash;like time&rdquo;) was still true on the microscopic level&mdash;meaning it supports the current understanding of physics at a macroscopic level. Choice D is incorrect. We can&rsquo;t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Neither text makes this distinction between laboratory findings and the way the universe works in general. </p>",

According to the second law of thermodynamics, at a macroscopic level some processes of heat transfer are irreversible due to the production of entropy&mdash;after a transfer we cannot rewind time and place molecules back exactly where they were before, just as we cannot unbreak dropped eggs. But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes <em>should</em> be reversible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>\n<p>In 2015, physicists Tiago Batalh&atilde;o et al. performed an experiment in which they confirmed the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field to a system of carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform. But the experiment &ldquo;does not pinpoint&nbsp;... what causes [irreversibility] at the microscopic level,&rdquo; coauthor Mauro Paternostro said.</p>",
