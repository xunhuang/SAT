  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The expression &ldquo;reconcile to&rdquo; means &ldquo;to cause (a person) to accept something difficult or disagreeable.&rdquo; The text suggests that John wants his mother to accept his desire to travel, even though she doesn&rsquo;t like that idea. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t make sense. John doesn&rsquo;t want his mother to apologize for his own desire to travel&mdash;he wants her to accept his desire to travel. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that John wants his mother to match his desire to travel. Rather, he wants her to accept his desire to travel even though she doesn&rsquo;t like it. Choice D is incorrect. This is tempting, because it seems to pick up on the idea of people &ldquo;reconciling&rdquo; after a fight, but it actually doesn&rsquo;t make sense. The text never suggests that John&rsquo;s mother was &ldquo;united with&rdquo; the idea of him traveling in the past&mdash;if anything, it seems like she&rsquo;s always been against it. Besides, it would be strange to say that a person &ldquo;reunites with&rdquo; a notion. </p>",
