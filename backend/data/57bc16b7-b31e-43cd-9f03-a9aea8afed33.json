It makes a generalization&mdash;the conflict had a lasting impact&mdash;and then supports it with evidence&mdash;the attention and protections were results of the conflict. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t make a generalization about the conflict. It describes a specific event from the conflict. Choice B is incorrect. This choice makes a generalization about the Alta conflict, but doesn&rsquo;t support it. Choice C is incorrect. This choice makes a statement about the aftermath of the conflict, but doesn&rsquo;t support it. The statement is also a little too specific to be a generalization. </p>",
