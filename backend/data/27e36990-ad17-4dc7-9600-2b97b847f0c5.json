  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. &ldquo;Nine months&hellip;offense&rdquo; and &ldquo;according to&hellip;system&rdquo; are both independent clauses. Separating them with a period and turning them into their own sentences is the only grammatically correct choice among the provided options. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a comma splice error, which is a punctuation error that occurs when two independent clauses are joined by only a comma. &ldquo;Nine months&hellip;offense&rdquo; and &ldquo;according to&hellip;system&rdquo; are both independent clauses, so they need to be either joined by a semicolon, joined by a comma and a coordinating conjunction, or separated by a period. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence, which occurs when two independent clauses are joined without punctuation. &ldquo;Nine months&hellip;offense&rdquo; and &ldquo;according to&hellip;system&rdquo; are both independent clauses, so they need to be either joined by a semicolon, joined by a comma and a coordinating conjunction, or separated by a period. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence, which occurs when two independent clauses are joined without punctuation. &ldquo;Nine months&hellip;offense&rdquo; and &ldquo;according to&hellip;system&rdquo; are independent clauses, so we would need to put a comma before the coordinating conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; to join them properly. </p>",
