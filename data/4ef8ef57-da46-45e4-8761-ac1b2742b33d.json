  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a supplementary phrase and a main clause. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the introductory supplementary phrase (&ldquo;By linking the Hudson River to Lake Erie&rdquo;), which identifies how the canal reduced transport time, and the main clause (&ldquo;the canal reduced transport time to nine days and cut costs to six dollars per ton&rdquo;). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a semicolon can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between a supplementary phrase (&ldquo;By&hellip;Erie&rdquo;) and the main clause (&ldquo;the canal...ton&rdquo;). Choice B is incorrect because an open parenthesis can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between a supplementary phrase (&ldquo;By&hellip;Erie&rdquo;) and the main clause (&ldquo;the canal...ton&rdquo;). Choice D is incorrect because a colon can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between an introductory supplementary phrase (&ldquo;By&hellip;Erie&rdquo;) and the main clause (&ldquo;the canal...ton&rdquo;). </p>",
