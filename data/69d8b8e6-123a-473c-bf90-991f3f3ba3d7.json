  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The past tense of \"suspended\" matches the past tense of \"applied,\" which has the same subject (\"he\") and takes place in the same context: \"He applied&hellip;and [he] suspended.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The perfect infinitive \"to have suspended\" doesn&rsquo;t match the past tense of \"applied,\" and it can&rsquo;t serve as a verb on its own. These are both verbs with the same subject and in the same context, so there&rsquo;s no need to shift tenses. Choice B is incorrect. The present participle \"suspending\" doesn&rsquo;t match the past tense of \"applied,\" and it can&rsquo;t serve as a verb on its own. These are both verbs with the same subject and in the same context, so there&rsquo;s no need to shift tenses. Choice C is incorrect. The infinitive \"to suspend\" doesn&rsquo;t match the past tense of \"applied,\" and it can&rsquo;t serve as a verb on its own. These are both verbs with the same subject and in the same context, so there&rsquo;s no need to shift tenses.</p>",
