  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence effectively presents Tan&rsquo;s research to an audience unfamiliar with Angkor Wat, explaining the results of the research and identifying Angkor Wat as a temple in Cambodia. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence presents Tan&rsquo;s research, it fails to explain what Angkor Wat is for an audience unfamiliar with the temple. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes the role that decorrelation stretch analysis played in Tan&rsquo;s research; it doesn&rsquo;t present the research, which would require specifying where it was conducted. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence explains what Angkor Wat is, it fails to present Tan&rsquo;s research. </p>",
