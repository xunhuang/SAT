  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a main clause and a supplementary phrase. In this choice, a colon is correctly used to mark the boundary between the main clause (&ldquo;A group&hellip;plant&rdquo;) and the supplementary element (&ldquo;TN57&hellip;pests&rdquo;) and to introduce the following elaboration on the specific varieties of sweet potato plants that were examined. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with &ldquo;TN57.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because a semicolon can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join the main clause (&ldquo;A group&hellip;plant&rdquo;) and the supplementary element (&ldquo;TN57&hellip;pests&rdquo;). A semicolon is conventionally used to join two main clauses, whereas a colon is conventionally used to introduce an element that explains or amplifies the information in the preceding clause. Choice C is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause (&ldquo;A group...plant&rdquo;) and the supplementary element (&ldquo;TN57...pests&rdquo;) with appropriate punctuation. </p>",
