  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the example of the high cost and low popularity of world&rsquo;s fairs. The text presents Chow&rsquo;s argument that the United States hasn&rsquo;t hosted a world&rsquo;s fair since 1984 because people think these exhibitions are overly expensive and insufficiently popular. The text then cites the 1984 World&rsquo;s Fair as an example, noting that it cost $350 million. Since the example should illustrate both high cost and insufficient popularity, the best completion of the example is the information from the table that the 1984 World&rsquo;s Fair had 7.35 million visitors. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents data from the table. The table indicates that the 1984 World&rsquo;s Fair, which is the world&rsquo;s fair used as an example in the text, had 7.35 million, not 9.60 million, visitors.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because it misrepresents data from the table. The table indicates that the 1984 World&rsquo;s Fair, which is the world&rsquo;s fair used as an example in the text, had 7.35 million, not 6.40 million, visitors.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because it misrepresents data from the table. The table indicates that the 1984 World&rsquo;s Fair, which is the world&rsquo;s fair used as an example in the text, had 7.35 million, not 5.60 million, visitors.&nbsp;</p>",
