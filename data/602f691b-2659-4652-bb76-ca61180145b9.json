I longed for sleep to obliterate them but it eluded me.

  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, \"completing\" most nearly means finishing. In the text, the narrator conveys that the task of translating a novel has been an all-consuming one and that she hopes things will \"be normal again\" once she has \"sent off the manuscript.\" In other words, the narrator is looking forward to finishing her work on the manuscript and returning to other things.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"completing\" doesn&rsquo;t mean destroying, or ruining. The narrator addresses her desire to send off the manuscript she&rsquo;s focused on and her hope that things will be \"normal again\" once she does, conveying that she is looking forward to finishing the work, not to ruining it. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"completing\" doesn&rsquo;t mean advertising, or publicly promoting. The narrator addresses her complete focus on the translation and her hope that things will be \"normal again\" once she has \"sent off the manuscript,\" conveying that she is looking forward to finishing the task, not to promoting the resulting manuscript. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"completing\" doesn&rsquo;t mean rejecting, or refusing or repelling. The narrator makes it clear that she is absorbed in working on the translation and plans to send off the manuscript, suggesting that instead of refusing to do the work, she is continuing to do it (even if she looks forward to things being \"normal again\" when she&rsquo;s done).</p>",
