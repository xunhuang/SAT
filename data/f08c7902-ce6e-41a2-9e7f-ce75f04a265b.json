  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period after &ldquo;essays&rdquo; is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (&ldquo;American&hellip;essays&rdquo;) and another (&ldquo;praising&hellip;Morrison&rdquo;). The participial phrase beginning with &ldquo;Praising&rdquo; modifies the subject of the second sentence, &ldquo;writer Robert Antoni.&rdquo; </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice B is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join sentences. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (&ldquo;American&hellip;essays&rdquo; and &ldquo;Praising&hellip;Morrison&rdquo;) are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. </p>",
