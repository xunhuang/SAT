  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a similarity between P waves and S waves, noting that they both travel beneath Earth&rsquo;s surface, thereby causing the ground to move.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes a difference between P waves and S waves, noting that P waves travel faster than S waves; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a similarity between the two types of waves. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes how P waves move; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a similarity between P waves and S waves. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence acknowledges that P waves and S waves start at the same point, it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a similarity; instead, the sentence emphasizes a difference between the two types of waves, noting that they behave very differently.</p>",
