Instead, the claim is true despite the previous claim. Choice C is incorrect because \"earlier\" illogically signals that the claim in the sentence occurs earlier in a chronological sequence of events than the previous claim about the speaker seeking out old public libraries. Instead, the claim is true despite the previous claim. Choice D is incorrect because \"in other words\" illogically signals that the claim in the sentence is merely a paraphrase or restatement of the previous claim about the speaker seeking out old public libraries. Instead, the claim is true despite the previous claim.</p>",
