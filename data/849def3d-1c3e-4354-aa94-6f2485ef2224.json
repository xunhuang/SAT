  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of non-finite (untensed) verb forms in a sentence. The modal &ldquo;would,&rdquo; which indicates the future from a perspective in the past, should be accompanied by a non-finite plain form verb. In this choice, the non-finite plain form verb &ldquo;create&rdquo; is used correctly in conjunction with the non-finite plain form verb &ldquo;increase&rdquo; to describe what the lock would do.\n&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because&nbsp;the finite present tense verb &ldquo;creates&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way with the modal &ldquo;would&rdquo; to describe what the lock would do. Choice C is incorrect because&nbsp;the present participle &ldquo;creating&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way with the modal &ldquo;would&rdquo; to describe what the lock would do. Choice D is incorrect because the finite past tense verb &ldquo;created&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way with the modal &ldquo;would&rdquo; to describe what the lock would do. </p>",
