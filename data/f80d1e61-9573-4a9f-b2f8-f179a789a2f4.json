  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. Lacadena&rsquo;s theory is that Nahuatl script symbols signified syllables, but the consensus described in Text 2 is that they can signify either symbols or full words, depending on the context. So the author of Text 2 would likely consider Lacadena&rsquo;s theory too simplistic: it&rsquo;s missing the importance of the context in determining the meaning of a symbol. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This conflicts with Text 1&rsquo;s description of Lacadena&rsquo;s theory. Lacadena&rsquo;s theory is that Nahuatl script symbols signified syllables. Choice B is incorrect. This conflicts with Text 1&rsquo;s description of Lacadena&rsquo;s theory. Text 1 states that Lacadena&rsquo;s theory differed from what earlier scholars believed. Choice C is incorrect. We can&rsquo;t infer that this is how the author of Text 2 would characterize Lacadena&rsquo;s theory. Neither text mentions how or even if the script changed over time. </p>",

Although many scholars had assumed that the symbols signified entire words, linguist Alfonso Lacadena theorized in 2008 that they signified units of language smaller than words: individual syllables.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>\n<p>The growing consensus among scholars of Nahuatl script is that many of its symbols could signify either words or syllables, depending on syntax and content at any given site within a text. For example, the symbol signifying the word <span lang=\"nah\"><em>huipil</em></span> (blouse) in some contexts could signify the syllable &ldquo;pil&rdquo; in others, as in the place name &ldquo;Chipiltepec.&rdquo; Thus, for the Aztecs, reading required a determination of how such symbols functioned each time they appeared in a text.</p>",
