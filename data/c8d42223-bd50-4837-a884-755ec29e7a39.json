  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence presents the significance of the Hart-Celler Act to an audience unfamiliar with the history of US immigration, noting that the 1965 act abolished the national-origins quota system and explaining why that mattered, historically: because the old quota system had favored immigrants from northern Europe. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes an aspect of immigration policy at the time the Hart-Celler Act was proposed; it doesn&rsquo;t present the significance of the Hart-Celler Act to an audience unfamiliar with the history of US immigration. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence describes an aspect of immigration policy before the Hart-Celler Act; it doesn&rsquo;t describe or present the significance of the act to an audience unfamiliar with the history of US immigration. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence indicates that the Hart-Celler Act abolished the old quota system, it doesn&rsquo;t explain the act or the quota system to an audience unfamiliar with the history of US immigration. </p>",
