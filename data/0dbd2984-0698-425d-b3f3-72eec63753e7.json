  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a subordinate clause and a main clause. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the subordinate clause (&ldquo;Because...content&rdquo;) and the main clause (&ldquo;scientists...settlements&rdquo;). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Joining the subordinate clause (&ldquo;Because...content&rdquo;) and the clause that follows (&ldquo;scientists...settlements&rdquo;) with the conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; results in an ungrammatical sentence that lacks a main clause. Choice C is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the subordinate clause and the main clause with appropriate punctuation. Choice D is incorrect. Joining the subordinate clause (&ldquo;Because...content&rdquo;) and the clause that follows (&ldquo;scientists...settlements&rdquo;) with a comma and the conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; results in an ungrammatical sentence that lacks a main clause. </p>",
