  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. This choice describes Adnan&rsquo;s <em>December from My Window</em> in a way that assumes the audience is already familiar with leporellos and focuses on the specific features of the work&mdash;its content and medium. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice isn&rsquo;t suited for an audience already familiar with leporellos. A familiar audience wouldn&rsquo;t need to have the term defined or explained. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t describe Adnan&rsquo;s <em>December from My Window</em>. It mentions the year and the type of work but not the content or the medium. In addition, it provides a simple definition of leporellos, making this an inappropriate choice for an audience already familiar with leporellos. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn&rsquo;t suited for an audience already familiar with leporellos. A familiar audience wouldn&rsquo;t need to have the term defined. </p>",
