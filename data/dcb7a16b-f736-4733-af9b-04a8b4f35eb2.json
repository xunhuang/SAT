The comma after &ldquo;variables&rdquo; is used conventionally to separate the first and second items in the series, and the comma after &ldquo;depths&rdquo; is used conventionally to separate the second and third items. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a colon can&rsquo;t be used in this way to separate items in a simple series. Choice C is incorrect because a comma is needed after &ldquo;variables&rdquo; to separate the first and second items in the series. Choice D is incorrect because a semicolon can&rsquo;t be used in this way to separate items in a simple series. </p>",
