While the sentence identifies Tantalus as the first synchrotron built to provide light, it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize (or mention) its location. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence describes synchrotrons and how researchers use them; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize (or mention) the location of Tantalus. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence describes synchrotron light and how researchers use it; the sentence doesn&rsquo;t emphasize (or mention) the location of Tantalus. </p>",
