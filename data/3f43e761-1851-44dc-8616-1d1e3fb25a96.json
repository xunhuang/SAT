  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence uses the quotation from Henderson to support a claim about Tharpe&rsquo;s contribution to rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll, noting that the impact Tharpe had on the genre led Henderson to call her \"the unquestioned founding mother of rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence makes the claim that Tharpe had a major impact on rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll, it doesn&rsquo;t use a quotation to support this claim. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence presents Henderson&rsquo;s opinion that Tharpe had a major impact on rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll, but it doesn&rsquo;t use a quotation to support this claim. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence includes a quotation about audience reactions to Tharpe&rsquo;s music, the sentence describes Tharpe as a gospel musician; it doesn&rsquo;t support a claim about her contribution to rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll.</p>",
