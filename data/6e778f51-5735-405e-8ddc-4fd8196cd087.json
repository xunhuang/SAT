  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. Because &ldquo;song preference plays a role in songbird mate selection,&rdquo; and because <em>F. hypoleuca</em> nestlings display a preference for local dialects, we can infer that they will be more likely to choose mates from local populations. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. We don&rsquo;t have any information suggesting that this preference disappears, so there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect. Although the passage discusses the number of begging calls made in response to various <em>F. hypoleuca</em> dialects, no mention is made about the amount of food received based on dialect preference. Therefore, there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. There&rsquo;s no mention in the passage of methods of other types of local songbirds, so there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference. </p>",

  "stimulus": "<p>Songbirds learn to respond to and imitate their species&rsquo; songs from an early age. With each generation, small differences are introduced that result in distinct variations&mdash;called dialects&mdash;among geographically isolated populations of the same species. A research study examined whether twelve-day-old <em>Ficedula hypoleuca</em> (pied flycatcher) nestlings prefer local dialects over the unfamiliar dialects of nonlocal <em>F. hypoleuca </em>populations: the more begging calls the nestlings made in response to a song, the stronger their preference. The researchers found that nestlings produced more begging calls in response to their own dialect than to nonlocal dialects. Since song preference plays a role in songbird mate selection, the finding suggests that <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",
