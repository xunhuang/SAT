The sentence emphasizes the significance of Ochoa&rsquo;s discovery, noting that it proved critical to deciphering the human genetic code, which resulted in a better understanding of how genetic variations affect human health. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence explains what Ochoa discovered, it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize the significance of the discovery. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence explains what Ochoa discovered, it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize the significance of the discovery. Choice D is incorrect.
