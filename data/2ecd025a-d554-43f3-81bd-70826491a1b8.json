  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase &ldquo;many critics&rdquo; the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase &ldquo;in assessing&hellip;Kurosawa.&rdquo; In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that it is the critics&mdash;and not another noun in the sentence&mdash;who assess Kurosawa&rsquo;s films. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase &ldquo;Kurosawa&rsquo;s&hellip;sources&rdquo; immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that his use of Western literary sources is what assesses Kurosawa&rsquo;s films. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the function word &ldquo;there&rdquo; immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that &ldquo;there&rdquo; is what assesses Kurosawa&rsquo;s films. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase &ldquo;the focus&hellip;critics&rdquo; immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the critics&rsquo; focus is what assesses Kurosawa&rsquo;s films. </p>",
