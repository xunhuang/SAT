  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. Noting that &ldquo;guerdon&rdquo; is of Anglo-French origin and &ldquo;Laodicean&rdquo; is of ancient Greek origin, the sentence uses &ldquo;while&rdquo; to emphasize a difference in the origins of the two words. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence emphasizes two words used in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize (or mention) the words&rsquo; linguistic origins. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence specifies the linguistic origin of one word used in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, it doesn&rsquo;t mention the other word or emphasize a difference in the two words&rsquo; origins. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence makes a generalization about words used in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference in the words&rsquo; origins. </p>",
