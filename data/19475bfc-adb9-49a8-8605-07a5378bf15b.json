  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Cole&rsquo;s book <em>Blind Spot</em>. In this context, &ldquo;enthusiasm for&rdquo; means excitement about. The text explains that <em>Blind Spot </em>consists of original photographs as well as poetic prose&mdash;two elements that correspond to Cole&rsquo;s passions, identified in the text, for photography and the written word. This context suggests that Cole&rsquo;s excitement about photography and writing led him to create a book that successfully combines the two mediums. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because describing Cole as feeling &ldquo;indifference to&rdquo; his two passions wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. If Cole is indifferent to his passions, that would mean he doesn&rsquo;t care about photography or writing&mdash;in which case they wouldn&rsquo;t be his passions at all. Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels &ldquo;concern about,&rdquo; or uneasiness about, his passions. The text&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;culminates&rdquo; indicates that <em>Blind Spot </em>represents a triumphant climax of Cole&rsquo;s passions, not a work that results from his sense of discomfort with photography and writing. Choice D is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels &ldquo;surprise at,&rdquo; or astonished by, his passions. The text indicates that Cole&rsquo;s feeling about his passions &ldquo;culminates&rdquo; in a book that &ldquo;evocatively&rdquo; combines photographs and writing, suggesting that Cole has a long-standing and skillful relationship to his passions, not that he is startled by them. </p>",
