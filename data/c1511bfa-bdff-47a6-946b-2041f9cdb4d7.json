  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a semicolon to join a main clause (&ldquo;Saville...novel&rdquo;) and a second main clause (&ldquo;she&rsquo;s...it&rdquo;) preceded by supplementary elements (&ldquo;rather...narrative&rdquo;). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, the comma after &ldquo;novel&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join the two main clauses. </p>",
