  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The text says that <em>N.pudica</em>&rsquo;s prey-catching pitchers are underground. It also says that the ridges where <em>N. pudica</em> lives don&rsquo;t have many plants and animals on the surface. This suggests that <em>N. pudica</em> evolved underground pitchers in order to catch more prey. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn&rsquo;t supported. The text never mentions the possibility of other undiscovered carnivorous plant species in Indonesia, so there&rsquo;s no basis to make this inference. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn&rsquo;t supported. The text does say that the ridges where <em>N. pudica</em> lives are dry, but it also says that the purpose of carnivorous plant pitchers is to capture prey. It never suggests that these pitchers also absorb moisture, so there&rsquo;s no basis to make this inference. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn&rsquo;t supported. The text never suggests that <em>N. pudica</em>&rsquo;s underground pitcher can catch animals on the surface, so there&rsquo;s no basis to make this inference. </p>",

  "stimulus": "<p>Martin Danƒç&aacute;k, Wewin Tjiasmanto, and colleagues have identified a new carnivorous plant species (<em>Nepenthes pudica</em>) in Indonesia. Like other carnivorous plants, <em>N. pudica</em> has pitfall traps, or pitchers, that capture prey, but unlike others, the pitchers of <em>N. pudica</em> are located underground. The researchers unearthed the new species on fairly dry ridges with surfaces that host few other plants and animals. Therefore, the researchers hypothesize that the <em>N. pudica</em> species likely <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",
