  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence uses &ldquo;both&rdquo; to emphasize a thematic similarity between Tan&rsquo;s two books, noting that both <em>Tales from Outer Suburbia</em> and <em>Tales from the Inner City </em>describe surreal events occurring in otherwise ordinary places. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes a difference (one contains fewer stories than the other), not a similarity, between the two books.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. The sentence indicates that Tan&rsquo;s books were published ten years apart; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a similarity between the two books. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence uses &ldquo;unlike&rdquo; to emphasize a difference between <em>Tales from Outer Suburbia</em> and <em>Tales from the Inner City</em>; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a similarity between the two books. </p>",
