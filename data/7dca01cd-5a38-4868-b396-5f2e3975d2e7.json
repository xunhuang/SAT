  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence uses the poem \"Towards Autumn\" to illustrate the form of a sestina, explaining that a sestina&rsquo;s thirty-nine lines all end in one of six alternating words and showcasing that poem&rsquo;s specific end words.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence identifies both of Hacker&rsquo;s poems as sestinas; it doesn&rsquo;t use one of the poems to illustrate the form of a sestina. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence appears to use the poem \"Forage Sestina\" to illustrate a feature of the sestina form, it misrepresents the information in the notes. According to the notes, \"Forage Sestina\" doesn&rsquo;t use these six end words; it uses six other words instead. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence uses the poem \"Towards Autumn\" as an example of one of Hacker&rsquo;s sestinas, it misrepresents the information in the notes. According to the notes, \"Towards Autumn\" doesn&rsquo;t use these six end words; it uses six other words instead.</p>",
