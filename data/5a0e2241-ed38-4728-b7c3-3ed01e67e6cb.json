  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a difference between the behavior of jellyfish and that of black dragonfish, noting that jellyfish and black dragonfish emit light as part of different behaviors (protection and predation, respectively). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes a similarity between jellyfish and black dragonfish; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between the behavior of the two animals. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes the type of bioluminescence exhibited by black dragonfish, noting that it&rsquo;s used in predation; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between the behavior of the two animals. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence defines bioluminescence and explains how it works; the sentence doesn&rsquo;t mention either animal or emphasize a difference between them. </p>",
