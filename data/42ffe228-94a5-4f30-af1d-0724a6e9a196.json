  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Nuttall&rsquo;s 1886 research paper. In this context, &ldquo;acknowledged&rdquo; means recognized as having a certain status. The text indicates that other researchers recognized Nuttall&rsquo;s work as groundbreaking because of its &ldquo;convincing demonstration&rdquo; related to the age of the ancient sculptures. In other words, the researchers recognized the groundbreaking status of Nuttall&rsquo;s work. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because in this context, &ldquo;ensured&rdquo; would mean to have guaranteed or made sure something was the case. The text states that other researchers gave Nuttall&rsquo;s work recognition after it was published, but there&rsquo;s no indication that they contributed to the work or had any involvement that would have allowed them to make sure the work would be groundbreaking. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that other researchers &ldquo;denied,&rdquo; or refused to admit or accept, that Nuttall&rsquo;s work was groundbreaking; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its &ldquo;convincing demonstration&rdquo; related to the age of the ancient sculptures. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that other researchers &ldquo;underestimated,&rdquo; or undervalued, Nuttall&rsquo;s work; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its &ldquo;convincing demonstration&rdquo; related to the age of the ancient sculptures. </p>",
