  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is finite and nonfinite verb forms within a sentence. Relative clauses, such as the one beginning with &ldquo;that,&rdquo; require a finite verb, a verb that can function as the main verb of a clause. This choice correctly supplies the clause with the finite future tense verb &ldquo;will be.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the nonfinite participle &ldquo;being&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the clause with a finite verb. Choice B is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive &ldquo;to be&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the clause with a finite verb. Choice C is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive &ldquo;to have been&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the clause with a finite verb. </p>",
