  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of finite verbs in a relative clause. Relative clauses, such as the one beginning with &ldquo;which,&rdquo; require a finite verb, a verb that can function as the main verb of a clause. This choice correctly supplies the clause with the finite past tense verb &ldquo;provided.&rdquo; </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the non-finite participle &ldquo;having provided&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the clause with a finite verb. Choice C is incorrect because the non-finite to-infinitive &ldquo;to provide&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the clause with a finite verb. Choice D is incorrect because the non-finite participle &ldquo;providing&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the clause with a finite verb. </p>",
