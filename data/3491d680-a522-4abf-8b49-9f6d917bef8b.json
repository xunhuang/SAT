This sentence is a statement: &ldquo;Moskowitz was hired by a soda company to determine how much artificial sweetener most people prefer in a diet drink.&rdquo; So a period is the most appropriate punctuation mark. &nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This sentence is not a question&mdash;it&rsquo;s a statement. So a question mark is not the appropriate punctuation.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. We already have the verbs &ldquo;was hired&hellip;to determine&rdquo; in this sentence. The verb &ldquo;do&rdquo; is not needed and results in a confusing, ungrammatical sentence.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This sentence is not a question&mdash;it&rsquo;s a statement. So a question mark is not the appropriate punctuation.&nbsp;</p>",
