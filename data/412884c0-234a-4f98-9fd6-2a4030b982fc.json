  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; most nearly means trace. The text portrays the narrator standing on the deck of a boat, admiring the view of nature afforded by this position: &ldquo;My soul had left its body to lose itself in the wild unrestrained beauty around me,&rdquo; says the narrator, &ldquo;and only left a trembling suggestion of its existence within me.&rdquo; This intense response to beauty is such that the narrator&rsquo;s soul seems to disengage from its body, leaving behind only a barely detectible indication of its presence there. In other words, the narrator senses only a trace of soul left in the body. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; can refer to an implied or indirectly expressed opinion, the text doesn&rsquo;t portray the narrator expressing an opinion; instead, the narrator is explaining an experience of intense emotion. Choice C is incorrect. While &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; might be used in some contexts to refer to the tactful expression of a differing viewpoint, it doesn&rsquo;t refer to the dispute or difference of opinion itself. Moreover, the text doesn&rsquo;t portray a dispute between characters with differing viewpoints. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; might be used to refer to a politely worded command, the text doesn&rsquo;t portray a scenario in which someone receives such a command. </p>",
