  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. A comma is the appropriate way to link the dependent clause &ldquo;While...not&rdquo; and the independent clause that follows. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. &ldquo;While...not&rdquo; is a dependent clause, which must be separated from the independent clause that follows with some sort of punctuation. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. &ldquo;While one requires oxygen and one does not&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t an independent clause, so it can&rsquo;t stand alone as a complete sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. &ldquo;While one requires oxygen and one does not&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t an independent clause, so it can&rsquo;t be linked to the clause that follows with a semicolon. </p>",
