  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of possessive determiners. The plural possessive determiner &ldquo;their&rdquo; agrees in number with the plural conjoined noun phrase &ldquo;Watson and Crick&rdquo; and thus indicates that the findings were those of Watson and Crick. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because &ldquo;they&rsquo;re&rdquo; is the contraction for &ldquo;they are,&rdquo; not a possessive determiner. Choice B is incorrect because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&rdquo; is the contraction for &ldquo;it is&rdquo; or &ldquo;it has,&rdquo; not a possessive determiner. Choice D is incorrect because&nbsp;the singular possessive determiner &ldquo;its&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t agree in number with the plural conjoined noun phrase &ldquo;Watson and Crick.&rdquo; </p>",
