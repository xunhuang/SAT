The sentence presents both the study and its findings, noting the study&rsquo;s date and the researcher&rsquo;s name as well as describing what the researcher determined about the jawbones and how she determined it. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence describes the study and the researcher&rsquo;s initial assessment, it doesn&rsquo;t present the study&rsquo;s findings. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence describes the study and its focus, it doesn&rsquo;t present the study&rsquo;s findings or the name of the researcher who conducted it. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the study&rsquo;s methodology and provides information about pterosaurs, it doesn&rsquo;t present the study&rsquo;s findings. </p>",
