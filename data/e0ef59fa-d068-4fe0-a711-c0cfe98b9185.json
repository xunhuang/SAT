  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. This choice uses a comma and a coordinating conjunction (&ldquo;and&rdquo;) to join two independent clauses (&ldquo;The Tantaquidgeon&hellip;Tribe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Today&hellip;country&rdquo;). </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error known as a run-on sentence. The clauses before and after &ldquo;Tribe&rdquo; are both independent, so they need to be separated with some sort of punctuation. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error known as a run-on sentence. The clauses before and after &ldquo;and&rdquo; are both independent, so they can&rsquo;t be linked with just a conjunction. A comma would also be required. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error called a comma splice. The clauses before and after &ldquo;Tribe&rdquo; are both independent, so they can&rsquo;t be linked with just a comma. A coordinating conjunction like &ldquo;and&rdquo; or &ldquo;but&rdquo; would also be required. </p>",
