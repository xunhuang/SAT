The sentence compares the lengths of the two rail tunnels, noting that the Channel Tunnel (about 31 miles long) is slightly shorter than the Seikan Tunnel (roughly 33 miles long).&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence makes a generalization about the length of some rail tunnels; it doesn&rsquo;t compare the lengths of the two rail tunnels. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence describes a single rail tunnel; it doesn&rsquo;t compare the lengths of the two rail tunnels. Choice D is incorrect.
