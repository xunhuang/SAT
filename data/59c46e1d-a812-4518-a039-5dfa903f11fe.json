  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. This quotation focuses on the rock, which yells at the sea and announces its intent to &ldquo;limit [the sea&rsquo;s] power.&rdquo; This matches the idea of confrontation and restraint in the claim we&rsquo;re trying to support. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t illustrate the claim. While this quotation does focus on the rock, it suggests that the rock fears the sea. It lacks the sense of boldness and strength implied by the phrase &ldquo;confront and restrain the sea.&rdquo; Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t illustrate the claim. This quotation focuses on the sea, not the rock. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t illustrate the claim. This quotation focuses on the sea, not the rock. </p>",
