  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a main clause and a supplementary phrase. In this choice, a colon is correctly used to mark the boundary between the main clause (&ldquo;A study&hellip;continents&rdquo;) and the supplementary phrase (&ldquo;geological&hellip;above&rdquo;) and to introduce the following explanation of the origin of Earth&rsquo;s continents. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause (&ldquo;A study&hellip;continents&rdquo;) and the supplementary phrase (&ldquo;geological&hellip;above&rdquo;) with appropriate punctuation. Choice C is incorrect because a semicolon can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join the main clause (&ldquo;A study&hellip;continents&rdquo;) and the supplementary phrase (&ldquo;geological&hellip;above&rdquo;). A semicolon is conventionally used to join two main clauses, whereas a colon is conventionally used to introduce an element that explains or amplifies the information in the preceding clause, making it the better choice in this context. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with &ldquo;geological.&rdquo; </p>",
