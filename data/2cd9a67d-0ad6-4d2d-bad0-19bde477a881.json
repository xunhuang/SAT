  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. &ldquo;Ultimately&rdquo; means &ldquo;in the long run&rdquo; or &ldquo;at the highest level.&rdquo; Although Bol&iacute;var wrote to a local merchant, his ultimate goal was to send a message to political leaders in Europe. Therefore, &ldquo;ultimately&rdquo; fits perfectly in this context. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. However, the second part of the sentence actually disagrees with the first part. Bol&iacute;var addressed the letter to Cullen, but he was really sending a message to someone else. Notice how the contrast word &ldquo;though&rdquo; also acts as a transition between these ideas. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition. Bol&iacute;var&rsquo;s writing of the letter to Cullen would not cause him to have a goal of persuading European powers to support him. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition. Bol&iacute;var&rsquo;s writing of the letter to Cullen would not cause him to have a goal of persuading European powers to support him. </p>",
