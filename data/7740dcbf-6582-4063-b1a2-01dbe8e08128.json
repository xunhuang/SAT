  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, &ldquo;spread&rdquo; most nearly means extended. The text states that the zoo is &ldquo;huge,&rdquo; that it covers &ldquo;numberless acres,&rdquo; and that it is large enough that a train is needed to explore it. Thus, the text&rsquo;s emphasis on the zoo&rsquo;s size suggests that the zoo extended, or stretched, over a large area of land. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because if the zoo covers &ldquo;numberless acres,&rdquo; then it could not reasonably be described as hidden, or concealed from view. Choice B is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the zoo was discussed, or talked about. Rather, the text focuses on the zoo&rsquo;s large size.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;spread&rdquo; can mean coated, it doesn&rsquo;t have that meaning in this context because to coat something means to apply a thin layer of a liquid substance, such as oil or paint, to a surface. Therefore, it would not be accurate to say that the zoo coated the acres on which it sits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
