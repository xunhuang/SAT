  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence makes a generalization about nissologists&rsquo; definition of an island&mdash;specifically, that the use of one definition rather than another can result in huge disparities in the number of islands counted&mdash;and supports that generalization by citing Sweden as an example. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence introduces one definition of an island to an audience unfamiliar with nissologists; it doesn&rsquo;t make a generalization about nissologists&rsquo; definition of an island.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence synthesizes information from the notes about counts of Sweden&rsquo;s islands, it doesn&rsquo;t make and support a generalization about nissologists&rsquo; definition of an island. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence makes an inference about islands in Sweden; it doesn&rsquo;t mention nissologists&rsquo; definition of an island or make a generalization about it.&nbsp;</p>",
