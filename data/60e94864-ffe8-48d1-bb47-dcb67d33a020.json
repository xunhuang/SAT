  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between the first sentence (&ldquo;The...adjustments&rdquo;) and the second sentence (&ldquo;Prior...days&rdquo;). Because the adverbial phrase beginning with &ldquo;prior&rdquo; indicates when changing a spreadsheet required redoing the sheet by hand, that phrase belongs with the second sentence.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. Two sentences are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice D is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join the sentences. </p>",
