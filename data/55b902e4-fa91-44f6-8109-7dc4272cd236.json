  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence makes a generalization&mdash;that a comet&rsquo;s orbit around the Sun may change over time&mdash;and supports the generalization with the example of the orbit of comet 81P/Wild, which once lay between the orbits of Uranus and Jupiter but is now positioned between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes the number of comets orbiting the Sun and makes a generalization about their orbits, but it doesn&rsquo;t support the generalization with an example. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence makes a generalization about comets and compares them to the planets Uranus, Jupiter, and Mars; it doesn&rsquo;t make and support a generalization about comets&rsquo; orbits. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence provides an example of a comet whose orbit has changed, it doesn&rsquo;t make a generalization about the orbits of comets. </p>",
