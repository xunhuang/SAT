  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence indicates the title of a novel that won a Nebula Award, noting that <em>Babel-17</em> by Samuel Delany won the award in 1967.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the sentence identifies the year that Samuel Delany published a science fiction novel; it doesn&rsquo;t indicate the novel&rsquo;s title or that it won a Nebula Award. Choice C is incorrect because the sentence provides an introduction of Samuel Delany; it doesn&rsquo;t indicate the title of a novel that has won a Nebula Award. Choice D is incorrect because the sentence indicates that one of Samuel Delany&rsquo;s novels met the qualification for a Nebula Award; it doesn&rsquo;t indicate the novel&rsquo;s title or that it won an award.</p>",
