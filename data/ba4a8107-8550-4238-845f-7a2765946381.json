  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The researchers concluded that the meteorite&rsquo;s nucleobases weren&rsquo;t the result of soil contamination. Presence of nucleobases in the meteorite and not in soil provides evidence that those nucleobases likely didn&rsquo;t come from the soil. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t justify the conclusion. The researchers concluded that the meteorite&rsquo;s nucleobases weren&rsquo;t the result of soil contamination. If the nucleobases are present in both the soil and meteorite, then it&rsquo;s possible that these nucleobases came from the soil. Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Purine was not detected in the soil sample. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Both isoguanine and hypoxanthine were detected in both Murchison meteorite samples. </p>",

By comparing the relative concentrations of types of molecules known as nucleobases in the Murchison meteorite with those in the soil, the team concluded that there is evidence that the nucleobases in the Murchison meteorite formed in space and are not the result of contamination on Earth.</p>",
