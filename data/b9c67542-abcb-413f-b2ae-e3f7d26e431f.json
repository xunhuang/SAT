  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. A consistent age difference of 2 billion years between certain stars within the thick disk would support the claim that the thick disk formed in two phases instead of one, with the second phase beginning 2 billion years after the first phase. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t support the claim. The researchers base their claim on their study of stars inside the thick disk of the Milky Way. This choice makes a comparison to stars in other galaxies, which isn&rsquo;t relevant. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t support the claim. The researchers base their claim on their study of stars inside the thick disk. This choice makes a comparison to the thin disk, which isn&rsquo;t relevant. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t support the claim. It&rsquo;s too general. The claim is specifically about the thick disk. </p>",

Based on computer simulations and analysis of data on the brightness, position, and chemical composition of about 250,000 stars in the thick disk (collected from two telescopes, one in China and one orbiting in space), astrophysicists Maosheng Xiang and Hans-Walter Rix claim that the thick disk of the Milky Way formed in two distinct phases rather than a single one.</p>",
