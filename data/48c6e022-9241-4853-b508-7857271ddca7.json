  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. This choice introduces Wong and <em>VGHS</em> in an active and specific way, as if to an audience unfamiliar with the series. It also sets up the time and genre of the web series, which are useful ways to introduce the series of events in a narrative. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice isn&rsquo;t suited for beginning a narrative. A narrative is a story that follows a sequence of events and creates interest and suspense for the reader. This choice jumps to the end, explaining the success of <em>VGHS</em> without explaining what it is. Choice C is incorrect. This choice isn&rsquo;t suited for beginning a narrative. It doesn&rsquo;t actually introduce the web series by name. It just jumps to later in the story without sufficient explanation. Choice D is incorrect. This choice is not very effective for beginning a narrative. It doesn&rsquo;t explain what <em>VGHS</em> is, and it doesn&rsquo;t mention Wong. </p>",
