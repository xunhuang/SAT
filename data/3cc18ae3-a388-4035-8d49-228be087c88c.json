  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. If there were more <em>Gidra</em> readers than there were copies of the newsletter, then the newsletter&rsquo;s influence would be much greater than its 4,000 monthly copies. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Information about the newsletter&rsquo;s initial funding doesn&rsquo;t tell us about the influence that the newsletter eventually had. Choice B is incorrect. While the content of <em>Gidra</em> was undoubtedly related to the newsletter&rsquo;s influence, this information isn&rsquo;t relevant to the specific hypothesis about monthly circulation numbers. Choice C is incorrect. Where the publishers of <em>Gidra</em> were initially based doesn&rsquo;t tell us about the newsletter&rsquo;s overall influence. </p>",

  "stimulus": "<p>As a monthly newsletter formed in 1969 by a group of Asian American students at the University of California, Los Angeles, <em>Gidra</em> helped raise awareness about social and political issues concerning the Asian American community on campus and at large. The newsletter had an expansive reach for a publication of its kind: around 4,000 copies were published each month. A student writing a history paper, however, hypothesizes that <em>Gidra</em>&rsquo;s influence cannot be measured by the number of newsletters published monthly alone.</p>",
