  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. This choice directly identifies the setting of Cather&rsquo;s novel <em>My &Aacute;ntonia</em> as Nebraska.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice mentions that Cather wrote about immigrants, but it doesn&rsquo;t indicate where they lived. Choice C is incorrect. This choice mentions that <em>My &Aacute;ntonia</em> is one of Cather&rsquo;s best-known novels but doesn&rsquo;t state where it takes place. Choice D is incorrect. This choice mentions that some of Cather&rsquo;s novels are set in Nebraska, but it doesn&rsquo;t specify which ones, so we can&rsquo;t be certain that <em>My &Aacute;ntonia</em> is one of them. It also includes irrelevant information about Cather&rsquo;s education.</p>",
