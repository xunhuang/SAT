  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s description of how Pico feels about the natural world. In this context, to say that Pico portrays his &ldquo;ambivalence toward&rdquo; nature would mean that he portrays his mixed feelings about nature. The text explains that Pico &ldquo;honors the centrality of nature&rdquo; and also makes it clear that he doesn&rsquo;t enjoy being in nature. This context suggests that Pico feels ambivalence toward nature. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his &ldquo;responsiveness to&rdquo; nature would mean that he portrays himself as quick to react to nature, which isn&rsquo;t supported by the text. Instead, the text focuses on Pico&rsquo;s mixed feelings toward nature, describing him as both honoring nature&rsquo;s role in his tribe&rsquo;s beliefs and expressing his personal dislike for being in nature.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his &ldquo;renunciation of&rdquo; nature would mean that he portrays himself as rejecting nature, which isn&rsquo;t supported by the text. The text conveys that Pico demonstrates both positive and negative responses toward nature, not that he&rsquo;s giving it up completely.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his &ldquo;mastery over&rdquo; nature would mean that he portrays himself as having control over nature, which isn&rsquo;t supported by the text. The text focuses on Pico&rsquo;s mixed feelings about nature; nothing in the text suggests that Pico feels mastery over nature. </p>",
