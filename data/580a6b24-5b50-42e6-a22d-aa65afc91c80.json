  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. Nothing belongs to the &ldquo;poems&rdquo; in the sentence, so it should not be possessive&mdash;just a simple plural noun. The protagonist does belong to the novel&mdash;it&rsquo;s the protagonist of the novel&mdash;so &ldquo;novel&rdquo; needs to be a singular possessive noun. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This choice uses the singular possessive &ldquo;poem&rsquo;s,&rdquo; but the text indicates that it should be the simple plural &ldquo;poems&rdquo;: there is more than one poem, and nothing belongs to the poems.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This choice uses the singular possessive &ldquo;poem&rsquo;s,&rdquo; but the text indicates that it should be the simple plural &ldquo;poems&rdquo;: there is more than one poem, and nothing belongs to the poems. This choice also uses the plural possessive &ldquo;novels&rsquo;,&rdquo; which is incorrect because there is only one novel.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This choice uses the plural possessive &ldquo;novels&rsquo;,&rdquo; which is incorrect because there is only one novel, so it should be the singular possessive &ldquo;novel&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp;. </p>",
