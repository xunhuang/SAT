  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The first sentence describes an experience that the viewer has when they&rsquo;re looking at the photos: they imagine other planets. This sentence describes an experience that the viewer has afterward: the title reminds them that the photos are of frying pans, bringing them back to reality. &ldquo;Ultimately&rdquo; is a transition that means &ldquo;eventually&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the end,&rdquo; so it fits the context perfectly. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense here. The viewer imagining other planets when they&rsquo;re looking at the photos doesn&rsquo;t cause the title to bring them back to reality. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates another option or possibility, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense here. Rather, the viewer has both experiences: first the viewer imagines that they&rsquo;re looking at another planet, and then the title reminds them that it&rsquo;s just a frying pan. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But the viewer&rsquo;s experience in the second sentence is actually the opposite of the viewer&rsquo;s experience in the first sentence. In the first sentence, the viewer is imagining that they&rsquo;re seeing a landscape from another planet. In the second sentence, the viewer is reminded that they&rsquo;re looking at a frying pan. </p>",
