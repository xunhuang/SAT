  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction &ldquo;but&rdquo; to join the first main clause (&ldquo;Human-made...fibers&rdquo;) and the second main clause (&ldquo;the manufacture...water&rdquo;). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice B is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it&rsquo;s conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.&nbsp;</p>",
