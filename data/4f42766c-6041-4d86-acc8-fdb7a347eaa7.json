  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. We&rsquo;re told that point-of-view shots and &ldquo;invisible editing&rdquo; make audiences identify with a character. We&rsquo;re also told that obvious editing and a lack of point-of-view shots have the opposite effect. Since the sequence in <em>The Birds</em> falls into this second category, it should have the effect of reducing the audience&rsquo;s connection with the protagonist. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn&rsquo;t mention viewers&rsquo; awareness of artifice (i.e., camera trickery) in films, so there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn&rsquo;t mention the director at all, so there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage doesn&rsquo;t discuss whether a film&rsquo;s &ldquo;stylistic attributes&rdquo; may distract viewers from the film&rsquo;s story, so there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference. </p>",

  "stimulus": "<p>Laura Mulvey has theorized that in narrative film, shots issuing from a protagonist&rsquo;s point of view compel viewers to identify with the character. Such identification is heightened by &ldquo;invisible editing,&rdquo; or editing so inconspicuous that it renders cuts between shots almost unnoticeable. Conversely, Mulvey proposes that conspicuous editing or an absence of point-of-view shots would induce a more critical stance toward a protagonist. Consider, for example, the attic scene in Alfred Hitchcock&rsquo;s <em>The Birds</em>, a conspicuously edited sequence of tens of shots, few of which correspond to the protagonist&rsquo;s point of view. According to Mulvey&rsquo;s logic, this scene should affect viewers by <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",
