The table shows five types of maple trees, each tree&rsquo;s maximum height, and whether each tree is native to North America. The text indicates that the student needs to recommend a maple tree that&rsquo;s native to North America and won&rsquo;t reach a height greater than 60 feet. The red maple is the only tree listed in the table that meets these criteria: its maximum height is 60 feet&mdash;meaning that it won&rsquo;t grow higher than 60 feet&mdash;and it&rsquo;s native to North America. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text states that the student needs to recommend a tree that&rsquo;s native to North America and won&rsquo;t grow higher than 60 feet, but the table shows that the maximum height of the silver maple is 70 feet.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the student needs to recommend a tree that&rsquo;s native to North America and won&rsquo;t grow higher than 60 feet, but the table shows that the maximum height of the sugar maple is 75 feet.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text states that the student needs to recommend a tree that&rsquo;s native to North America and won&rsquo;t grow higher than 60 feet, but the table shows that the Norway maple isn&rsquo;t native to North America.&nbsp;</p>",
