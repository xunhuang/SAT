  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementary element within a sentence. The comma after &ldquo;(13C)&rdquo; pairs with the comma after &ldquo;isotope&rdquo; to separate the supplementary element &ldquo;carbon-13 (13C)&rdquo; from the rest of the sentence. This supplementary element defines the &ldquo;rare carbon isotope,&rdquo; and the pair of commas indicates that this element could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the supplementary element &ldquo;carbon-13 (13C)&rdquo; from the rest of the sentence.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the supplementary element &ldquo;carbon-13 (13C)&rdquo; from the rest of the sentence. Choice C is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the supplementary element &ldquo;carbon-13 (13C)&rdquo; from the rest of the sentence. The comma after &ldquo;carbon-13&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t necessary because the parentheses around &ldquo;13C&rdquo; already separate this element from the rest of the sentence. </p>",
