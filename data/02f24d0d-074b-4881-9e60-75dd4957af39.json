  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. \"For this reason\" logically signals that the reason Joseph Priestley termed oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\" was that he accepted the theory mentioned in the previous sentence&mdash;that the presence of phlogiston, rather than the absence of oxygen, causes fire in a closed container to go out.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because \"in other words\" illogically signals that the information about Priestley terming oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\" is a restatement of the previous theory concerning phlogiston. Instead, Priestley chose the term as a result of this theory. Choice C is incorrect because \"alternatively\" illogically signals that Priestley termed oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\" as an alternative to the previous theory concerning phlogiston. Instead, Priestley chose the term as a result of this theory. Choice D is incorrect because \"nevertheless\" illogically signals that Priestley termed oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\" despite the previous theory concerning phlogiston. Instead, Priestley chose the term as a result of this theory.</p>",
