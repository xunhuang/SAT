The sentence emphasizes a difference between the two approaches to dyeing blue jeans, noting that Rai&rsquo;s approach uses a natural, plant-based substance in place of hazardous chemicals.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes a similarity between the dyes used in the two approaches, noting that the dyes contain the same ingredient; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between the two approaches to dyeing blue jeans. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence explains what nanocellulose is; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between the two approaches to dyeing blue jeans. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence explains the traditional approach to dyeing blue jeans; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between the traditional approach and Rai&rsquo;s approach.</p>",
