  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents a quotation illustrating the claim that the poem conveys McKay&rsquo;s contrasting feelings about New York City and Jamaica. McKay first presents a somewhat negative view of New York City, describing watching &ldquo;dark figures&rdquo; who &ldquo;sadly shuffle&rdquo; to work at dawn, and then indicates that he would instead like to be &ldquo;in the heart of the island of the sea.&rdquo; </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the quotation focuses on a description of only one place (New York City, with its &ldquo;lonely newsboy&rdquo; and &ldquo;red streaks&rdquo; in the sky at dawn) rather than on different feelings about two places. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation focuses on a description of only one place (which isn&rsquo;t named) rather than on McKay&rsquo;s different feelings about two places. Choice D is incorrect because though McKay presents a negative image of an unnamed place with &ldquo;tired cars&rdquo; that grumble, moan, and groan, and &ldquo;old milk carts&ldquo; that rumble by under &ldquo;dull stars,&rdquo; the quotation focuses on McKay&rsquo;s feelings about only one place rather than on different feelings about two places. </p>",
