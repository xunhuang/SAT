  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence describes Fung&rsquo;s location in Kang&rsquo;s photograph, noting that Fung is seated on the floor. Additionally, because the sentence is intended for an audience already familiar with the artists, it omits the artists&rsquo; first names and other biographical information about them.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence indicates that Fung appears in Kang&rsquo;s photograph; it doesn&rsquo;t describe Fung&rsquo;s location in Kang&rsquo;s photograph. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence identifies Kang and where she is based; it doesn&rsquo;t describe Fung&rsquo;s location in Kang&rsquo;s photograph. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence describes the background of Kang&rsquo;s photograph; it doesn&rsquo;t describe Fung&rsquo;s location in Kang&rsquo;s photograph.</p>",
