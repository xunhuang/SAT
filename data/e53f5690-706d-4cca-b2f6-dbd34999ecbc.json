  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The text tells us that the farther the correlation is from 0, the &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; it is (doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s negative or positive). The table shows that the correlations with velocity are farther from zero than the correlations with density, which supports the conclusion that the correlations with velocity are stronger. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t support the conclusion. It makes an &ldquo;apples to oranges&rdquo; comparison by comparing density and velocity correlations across features instead of comparing them for each feature. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t support the conclusion. It doesn&rsquo;t include the density correlations for comparison. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t support the conclusion. The text tells us that the farther the correlation is from 0, the &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; it is: it doesn&rsquo;t matter for &ldquo;strength&rdquo; whether it&rsquo;s negative or positive. </p>",
