  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. The main clause of a sentence requires a finite (tensed) verb, and this choice supplies the finite present tense verb &ldquo;explain&rdquo; to indicate what the scientists do. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle &ldquo;having explained&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle &ldquo;explaining&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive &ldquo;to explain&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb. </p>",
