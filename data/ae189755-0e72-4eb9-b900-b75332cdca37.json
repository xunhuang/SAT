The sentence contrasts the number of meteorite falls with the number of meteorite finds, noting that there have been over 60,000 meteorite finds but only about 1,200 recorded meteorite falls.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence explains the difference between meteorite falls and meteorite finds, it doesn&rsquo;t contrast the number of meteorite falls and meteorite finds. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence indicates the two categories of meteorites found on Earth; it doesn&rsquo;t contrast the number of meteorite falls and meteorite finds. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence notes the number of recorded meteorite falls, it doesn&rsquo;t contrast this with the number of meteorite finds.</p>",
