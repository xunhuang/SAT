  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. &ldquo;Previously&rdquo; logically signals that the fused fiber theory came before Ram&oacute;n y Cajal&rsquo;s discovery. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. &ldquo;However&rdquo; illogically signals that the fused fiber theory in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence. While this theory does contrast with Ram&oacute;n y Cajal&rsquo;s discovery, the previous sentence concludes by stating that his discovery went against prior assumptions about the brain. The fact that the fused fiber theory was one of those earlier assumptions makes &ldquo;however&rdquo; an illogical choice. Choice C is incorrect because &ldquo;as a result&rdquo; illogically signals that the fused fiber theory in this sentence was a result of the discovery in the previous sentence. Instead, the fused fiber theory came before Ram&oacute;n y Cajal&rsquo;s discovery. Choice D is incorrect because &ldquo;likewise&rdquo; illogically signals that the fused fiber theory in this sentence was similar to the discovery in the previous sentence. Instead, the fused fiber theory, which came before Ram&oacute;n y Cajal&rsquo;s discovery, was very different from it. </p>",
