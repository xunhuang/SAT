  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The clause &ldquo;Like an Elvis impersonator&hellip;real thing&rdquo; and the clause &ldquo;it is&hellip;look-alike&rdquo; are both independent clauses, so making them into two separate sentences is grammatically correct.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause &ldquo;Like an Elvis impersonator&hellip;real thing&rdquo; and the clause &ldquo;it is&hellip;look-alike&rdquo; are both independent clauses, so they need to be separated with at least a comma + a coordinating conjunction. This choice provides the coordinating conjunction &ldquo;but,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s missing a comma. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause &ldquo;Like an Elvis impersonator&hellip;real thing&rdquo; and the clause &ldquo;it is&hellip;look-alike&rdquo; are both independent clauses, so they need to be separated with a semicolon, a colon, a dash, a period, or a comma + a coordinating conjunction. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause &ldquo;Like an Elvis impersonator&hellip;real thing&rdquo; and the clause &ldquo;it is&hellip;look-alike&rdquo; are both independent clauses, so they need to be separated with at least a comma + a coordinating conjunction. This choice provides a comma, but it&rsquo;s missing a coordinating conjunction. </p>",
