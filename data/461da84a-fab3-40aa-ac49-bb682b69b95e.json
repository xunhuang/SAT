In this choice, the future tense verb &ldquo;will learn,&rdquo; used in conjunction with the phrase &ldquo;in a later chapter,&rdquo; correctly indicates that &ldquo;you&rdquo; (the reader) are going to learn about obsidian&rsquo;s structure at some point in the future. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the past perfect verb &ldquo;had learned&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the subject is going to learn about obsidian&rsquo;s structure in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the past perfect progressive verb &ldquo;had been learning&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the subject is going to learn about obsidian&rsquo;s structure in the future. Choice D is incorrect because the present perfect verb &ldquo;have learned&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the subject is going to learn about obsidian&rsquo;s structure in the future. </p>",
