  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, &ldquo;beckoning&rdquo; most nearly means &ldquo;inviting,&rdquo; or attractive. The text portrays a woman who is looking at &ldquo;trees in their spring beauty.&rdquo; She compares them to cities, which have their own pleasures even if they do not have the &ldquo;easy unhuman loveliness&rdquo; of trees: she thinks of cities as &ldquo;seductive&rdquo; and &ldquo;charming,&rdquo; both adjectives that signify something that is enticing, or attractive. Therefore, cities that are seductive and charming would also be described as inviting people closer to them. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in this context that cities are &ldquo;demanding,&rdquo; or requiring effort. Choice B is incorrect. Though &ldquo;signaling,&rdquo; or communicating something, might be considered a key feature of the act of &ldquo;beckoning,&rdquo; in the context here, &ldquo;beckoning&rdquo; suggests that cities have attractive qualities that naturally draw people to them. Such attractive qualities are not described by the word &ldquo;signaling&rdquo; alone. Therefore, &ldquo;signaling&rdquo; is an incorrect answer because it is insufficiently precise. Choice D is incorrect because there is no reason to think in this context that the cities are &ldquo;shifting,&rdquo; or changing shape. </p>",
