  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to establish the narrator&rsquo;s feelings about the piano. The narrator reveals that she &ldquo;had to act really happy&rdquo; about the piano even though she &ldquo;pretty much hated the thing&rdquo; as soon as it was placed upstairs near her bedroom. The narrator also describes the piano as glaring at her and compares it to a caged bird that wants to be set free. These details establish the narrator&rsquo;s feelings about the piano, suggesting that it makes her uneasy. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the narrator hated having the piano upstairs right next to her bedroom, not that she wanted a piano to be close to her bedroom. Choice C is incorrect because the only information provided in the text about the narrator&rsquo;s brothers is that they were given the piano along with the narrator. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not describe the event that led the narrator&rsquo;s parents to buy the piano from the people moving to Utah. Instead, the text focuses on the narrator&rsquo;s feelings about the piano after it was given to her and her brothers. </p>",

Mom and Dad gave it to my brothers and me for Christmas. I had to act really happy because it was such a big present, but I pretty much hated the thing from the second it was carried into the hallway upstairs, which is right next to my bedroom. The piano glared at me. It was like a songbird in a cage. It wanted to be set free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span class=\"dap_copyright\">&copy;2017 by Holly Goldberg Sloan</span></p>",
