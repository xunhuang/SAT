  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of finite and nonfinite verb forms within a sentence. A main clause requires a finite verb to perform the action of the subject (in this case, &ldquo;some historians&rdquo;), and this choice supplies the finite present tense verb &ldquo;claim&rdquo; to indicate what some historians do.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the nonfinite participle &ldquo;claiming&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice C is incorrect because the nonfinite participle &ldquo;having claimed&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice D is incorrect because the nonfinite to-infinitive &ldquo;to claim&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb. </p>",
