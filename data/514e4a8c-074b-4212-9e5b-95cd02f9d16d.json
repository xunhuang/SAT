  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes the aim of the research study by highlighting what the researchers conducting the study wanted to know&mdash;specifically, which factors influence clutch size among lizards. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the sentence emphasizes what researchers determined at the end of the study, not what the study&rsquo;s aim was. Choice C is incorrect because the sentence emphasizes a finding from the research study, not the aim of the study. Choice D is incorrect because the sentence emphasizes the research study&rsquo;s methodology, not its aim. </p>",
