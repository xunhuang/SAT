  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence compares some disadvantages of docked and dockless bike-share programs, explaining that while docked programs are more resource-intensive (requiring significant space and money), dockless programs have greater organizational challenges.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence compares dockless programs to docked programs, noting an advantage of docked programs: they offer order and consistency. It doesn&rsquo;t compare disadvantages of the two types of programs. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence compares dockless programs to docked programs, noting an advantage of dockless programs: they are easy and inexpensive to implement. However, it misrepresents information from the notes, stating that dockless programs are less flexible than docked programs. In addition, it doesn&rsquo;t compare disadvantages of the two types of programs. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes an advantage of dockless programs, then makes a general statement that applies to both types of programs; it doesn&rsquo;t compare disadvantages of the two types of programs.</p>",
