  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of possessive determiners. The plural possessive determiner \"their\" agrees in number with the plural noun \"the poems,\" thus indicating that the poems had eight panels of text stitched together in the shape of a traditional eight-pointed Lakota star quilt.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because \"it&rsquo;s\" is the contraction for \"it is\" or \"it has,\" not a possessive determiner. Choice C is incorrect because \"they&rsquo;re\" is the contraction for \"they are,\" not a possessive determiner. Choice D is incorrect becauseâ€¯the singular possessive determiner \"its\" doesn&rsquo;t agree in number with the plural noun \"the poems.\"</p>",
