  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. &ldquo;Nonetheless&rdquo; is a transition that indicates disagreement. The first sentence describes the unlikelihood of finding much for critical analysis in Ashbery&rsquo;s poem (&ldquo;barren terrain&rdquo;), while the second sentence describes how Berlant did in fact find much to analyze in Ashbery&rsquo;s poem (&ldquo;fertile ground&rdquo;), so the transition &ldquo;nonetheless&rdquo; fits perfectly. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new but similar idea, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense here. The idea in this sentence directly contradicts the idea in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense in this context&mdash;a poem seemingly having little opportunity for critical analysis would not cause someone to write an extensive critical analysis (in fact, we might expect the opposite). Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in other words. But the text isn&rsquo;t restating the first idea here. Instead, it&rsquo;s offering a contradiction to the idea expressed in the first sentence. </p>",
