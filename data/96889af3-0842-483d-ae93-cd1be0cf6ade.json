  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is finite verb use in a main clause. A main clause requires a finite verb to perform the action of the subject (in this case, Ashford&rsquo;s &ldquo;gestures&rdquo; and &ldquo;habit&rdquo;), and this choice supplies the finite past tense verb &ldquo;helped&rdquo; to indicate what Ashford&rsquo;s gestures and habit helped accomplish. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the non-finite participle &ldquo;helping&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice C is incorrect because the relative clause &ldquo;that helped&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice D is incorrect because the non-finite to-infinitive &ldquo;to help&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t supply the main clause with a finite verb. </p>",
