  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense. In this choice, the past perfect verb &ldquo;had doubled&rdquo; properly indicates that the doubling of the organization&rsquo;s initial membership occurred during a specific period before the present (between the organization&rsquo;s founding in 1967 and the end of the 1990s).&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the present perfect verb &ldquo;has doubled&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the organization&rsquo;s doubling of its initial membership occurred during a specific period in the past.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the present tense verb &ldquo;doubles&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the organization&rsquo;s doubling of its initial membership occurred during a specific period in the past. Choice D is incorrect because the future tense verb &ldquo;will double&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the organization&rsquo;s doubling of its initial membership occurred during a specific period in the past. </p>",
