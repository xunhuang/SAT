  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Booker T. Whatley. In this context, &ldquo;hinder&rdquo; means hold back or obstruct. The text explains that Whatley encouraged farms to allow customers on site to pick their own produce for a fee. He did so despite critics&rsquo; concerns that the customers would never pay to do so. This context establishes that the critics&rsquo; concerns didn&rsquo;t hinder Whatley&rsquo;s efforts to promote the practice. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text indicates that critics&rsquo; skepticism of the idea that customers would pay to pick their own produce didn&rsquo;t have some effect on Whatley&rsquo;s promotion of the practice. The text illustrates this assertion by describing Whatley&rsquo;s &ldquo;determined advocacy&rdquo; for the practice. This context suggests that critics&rsquo; concerns didn&rsquo;t obstruct Whatley&rsquo;s efforts, not that critics&rsquo; concerns didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;enhance,&rdquo; or increase or improve, Whatley&rsquo;s efforts.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because in this context, &ldquo;misrepresent&rdquo; would mean portray inaccurately, and the text includes no information relevant to the issue of how Whatley&rsquo;s efforts were portrayed by critics of the practice of charging customers to pick their own produce. Choice D is incorrect. The text indicates that critics&rsquo; skepticism of the idea that customers would pay to pick their own produce didn&rsquo;t have some effect on Whatley&rsquo;s promotion of the practice. The text illustrates this assertion by describing Whatley&rsquo;s &ldquo;determined advocacy&rdquo; for the practice. This context suggests that critics&rsquo; concerns didn&rsquo;t obstruct Whatley&rsquo;s efforts, not that critics&rsquo; concerns didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;aggravate,&rdquo; or irritate or make more severe, Whatley&rsquo;s efforts. </p>",
