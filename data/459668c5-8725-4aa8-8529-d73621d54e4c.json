  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence makes a generalization about the materials used in dhow replicas, noting that while some modern materials are used, most of the materials are traditional.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence provides an example of a traditional material used in ancient dhows; it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the material is used in dhow replicas or make any other generalization about materials used in those replicas. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence explains what an ancient dhow was; it doesn&rsquo;t make a generalization about materials used to make dhow replicas. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence introduces the construction of dhow replicas to an audience unfamiliar with the vessel; it doesn&rsquo;t make a generalization about the materials used in those replicas.</p>",
