Since the antecedent in this case is the singular noun phrase \"the human brain,\" \"it\" is a perfect pronoun to use here.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although \"she\" is a singular pronoun, it is reserved for people and animals, not objects like \"the human brain.\" Choice B is incorrect. \"They\" is a plural pronoun, but we need a singular pronoun to represent the antecedent \"the human brain.\" Choice D is incorrect. \"Those\" is a plural pronoun, but we need a singular pronoun to represent the antecedent \"the human brain.\"</p>",
