  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementary word or phrase between two main clauses. This choice correctly uses a comma to separate the supplementary adverb &ldquo;however&rdquo; from the preceding main clause (&ldquo;Okinaka doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;single-handedly&rdquo;) and a semicolon to join the next main clause (&ldquo;all&hellip;culture&rdquo;) to the rest of the sentence. Further, placing the semicolon after &ldquo;however&rdquo; correctly indicates that the information in the preceding main clause (Okinaka doesn&rsquo;t make such decisions single-handedly) is contrary to what might be assumed from the information in the previous sentence (Okinaka sits on the review board that adds new sites to the Hawaii Register of Historic Places). </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because placing the semicolon after &ldquo;single-handedly&rdquo; and the comma after &ldquo;however&rdquo; illogically indicates that the information in the next main clause (all historical designations must be approved by a group of experts) is contrary to the information in the previous clause (Okinaka doesn&rsquo;t make such decisions single-handedly).&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Commas can&rsquo;t be used in this way to punctuate a supplementary word or phrase between two main clauses.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. </p>",
