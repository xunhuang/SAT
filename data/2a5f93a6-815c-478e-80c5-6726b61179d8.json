Choice C is incorrect because the future tense verb &ldquo;will vow&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t consistent with the past tense verbs used to narrate&nbsp;the events surrounding President Roosevelt&rsquo;s decision to conserve the nation&rsquo;s wilderness areas. Choice D is incorrect because the simple present tense verb &ldquo;vows&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t consistent with the past tense verbs used to narrate&nbsp;the events surrounding President Roosevelt&rsquo;s decision to conserve the nation&rsquo;s wilderness areas. </p>",
