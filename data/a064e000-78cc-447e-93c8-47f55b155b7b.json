  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. Both texts are critical of <em>The Guns of August</em>, but for different reasons: the author of Text 1 argues that Tuchman missed an important factor leading up to the war because she didn&rsquo;t consult secondary sources, and the author of Text 2 argues that Tuchman&rsquo;s main thesis is \"reductive,\" which is a close synonym for \"overly simplistic.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t accurately describe the difference. This choice&rsquo;s summary of Text 1 is accurate, but Text 2 never says that Tuchman&rsquo;s most interesting claims result from her original research. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t accurately describe the difference. Text 1 never says that <em>The Guns of August</em> is worthwhile to read despite its research weaknesses. Text 2 does call out a weakness of Tuchman&rsquo;s interpretation of events, but it also praises her analysis of primary sources. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t accurately describe the difference. Text 1 actually says that Tuchman \"fails to address\" the influence of events in Eastern Europe, while Text 2 says that Tuchman&rsquo;s thesis was that European powers (not Eastern European leaders) were committed to military plans.</p>",

  "stimulus": "<p><strong><span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\">Text 1</span></strong></p>\n<p>Despite its beautiful prose, <em>The Guns of August</em>, Barbara Tuchman&rsquo;s 1962 analysis of the start of World War I, has certain weaknesses as a work of history. It fails to address events in Eastern Europe just before the outbreak of hostilities, thereby giving the impression that Germany was the war&rsquo;s principal instigator. Had Tuchman consulted secondary works available to her by scholars such as Luigi Albertini, she would not have neglected the influence of events in Eastern Europe on Germany&rsquo;s actions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\">Text 2</span></strong></p>\n<p>Barbara Tuchman&rsquo;s <em>The Guns of August </em>is an engrossing if dated introduction to World War I. Tuchman&rsquo;s analysis of primary documents is laudable, but her main thesis that European powers committed themselves to a catastrophic outcome by refusing to deviate from military plans developed prior to the conflict is implausibly reductive.</p>",
