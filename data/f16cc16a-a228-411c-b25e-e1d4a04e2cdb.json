  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. Noting that the Sun (9,800&deg;F) is hotter than most stars within 10 parsecs of it, the sentence emphasizes how hot the Sun is relative to nearby stars. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The sentence explains that astronomer Todd Henry determined the classifications for the Sun and several other stars nearby; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize how hot the Sun is relative to nearby stars.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect. The sentence explains that the majority of stars near the Sun are classified as K or M stars; it doesn&rsquo;t indicate the Sun&rsquo;s temperature or emphasize how hot it is relative to nearby stars. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence indicates that the Sun is classified differently than most nearby stars due to its surface temperature, it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize how hot the Sun is relative to nearby stars. </p>",
