  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. By noting that the formula for distributing Storting seats overrepresents less populated rural districts, the sentence effectively refutes a claim that malapportionment in the Storting favors small urban districts.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the sentence claims that malapportionment in the Storting favors small urban districts; it doesn&rsquo;t refute such a claim. Moreover, it misrepresents information in the notes. According to the notes, the formula for distributing seats overrepresents less populated, not more populated, districts. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence appears to refute a claim that malapportionment in the Storting favors small urban districts, it misrepresents information in the notes. According to the notes, the formula for distributing seats overrepresents less populated, not more populated, districts. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence explains what malapportionment is but doesn&rsquo;t address malapportionment in the Storting specifically.</p>",
