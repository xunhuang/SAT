  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence presents both the study and its methodology (that is, the researcher&rsquo;s approach to the problem), explaining that Yuan used computer simulations to study the effect of the mother duck&rsquo;s wake on the ducklings&rsquo; energy expenditure. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes the findings of Yuan&rsquo;s study; it doesn&rsquo;t present the study and its methodology.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence provides general information about Yuan&rsquo;s study, it doesn&rsquo;t present the study&rsquo;s methodology. Choice D is incorrect.
