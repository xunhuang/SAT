  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence effectively introduces Cathryn Halverson&rsquo;s book to an audience already familiar with the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, noting the title of Halverson&rsquo;s book and describing its content without providing background information about the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The sentence introduces the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> and mentions that it&rsquo;s referred to in Cathryn Halverson&rsquo;s book title; it doesn&rsquo;t effectively introduce Halverson&rsquo;s book. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence assumes that the audience is unfamiliar with the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, providing background information about the magazine; it doesn&rsquo;t effectively introduce Halverson&rsquo;s book to an audience already familiar with the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence assumes that the audience is familiar with the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, it doesn&rsquo;t effectively introduce Cathryn Halverson&rsquo;s book. </p>",
