  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence specifies why historians believe Abele designed most of Duke&rsquo;s campus buildings, noting that most of the buildings feature architectural styles that Abele had studied. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence explains that historians believe Abele designed most of Duke&rsquo;s campus buildings, it doesn&rsquo;t specify why historians hold that belief. Choice C is incorrect because the sentence emphasizes the architectural styles of Duke&rsquo;s campus buildings; it doesn&rsquo;t specify why historians believe Abele designed the buildings. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence explains that Abele is believed to have designed most of the buildings on Duke&rsquo;s campus, it doesn&rsquo;t specify why historians believe that he designed the buildings. </p>",
