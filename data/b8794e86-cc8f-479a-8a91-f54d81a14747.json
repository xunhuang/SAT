  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense in a sentence. In this choice, the present perfect tense verb &ldquo;have contributed,&rdquo; used in conjunction with the phrase &ldquo;since it began in 2012,&rdquo; correctly indicates that map editors have contributed in the past and continue to do so in the present. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the present tense verb &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; is inconsistent with the phrase &ldquo;since it began in 2012,&rdquo; which suggests that the contributions occurred in the past and continue into the present. Choice B is incorrect because the future tense verb &ldquo;will contribute&rdquo; is inconsistent with the phrase &ldquo;since it began in 2012,&rdquo; which suggests that the contributions occurred in the past and continue into the present. Choice D is incorrect because the future tense verb &ldquo;will be contributing&rdquo; is inconsistent with the phrase &ldquo;since it began in 2012,&rdquo; which suggests that the contributions occurred in the past and continue into the present. </p>",
