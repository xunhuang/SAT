  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period after &ldquo;Bay&rdquo; is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (&ldquo;On&hellip;Bay&rdquo;) and another sentence that begins with a supplementary phrase (&ldquo;Having&hellip;years&rdquo;). Here, the supplementary phrase beginning with &ldquo;having&rdquo; modifies the subject of the second sentence, &ldquo;the celebrated ship.&rdquo; </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join sentences. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join two sentences. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (&ldquo;On&hellip;Bay&rdquo; and &ldquo;having&hellip;years&rdquo;) are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. </p>",
