  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of possessive determiners. The plural possessive determiner \"their\" agrees in number with the plural noun \"types\" and thus indicates that the more personal subject matter of Marisol&rsquo;s 1968 sculpture takes the place of those types of pop culture references that made Marisol a star.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the singular possessive determiner \"its\" doesn&rsquo;t agree in number with the plural noun \"types.\" Choice B is incorrect because \"they&rsquo;re\" is the contraction for \"they are,\" not a possessive determiner. Choice D is incorrect because \"it&rsquo;s\" is the contraction for \"it is\" or \"it has,\" not a possessive determiner.</p>",
