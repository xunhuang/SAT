  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Samuel R. Delany&rsquo;s character Rydra Wong. As used in this context, &ldquo;atypical&rdquo; would mean unrepresentative or not common. The text indicates that Wong is one of &ldquo;nearly a dozen&rdquo; characters in Delany&rsquo;s novels who are poets or writers. This context conveys that being a poet isn&rsquo;t an atypical occupation for a character in one of Delany&rsquo;s works. &nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; means to be accurate or without fault, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers. This context suggests that the occupation isn&rsquo;t atypical for Delany, not that the occupation isn&rsquo;t infallible, or problematic.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because &ldquo;lucrative&rdquo; means to be profitable, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. If writing poet characters weren&rsquo;t profitable, it wouldn&rsquo;t be logical to explain this by citing that Delany gave many of his characters the same occupation.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because &ldquo;tedious&rdquo; means to be boring, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers. This context suggests that the occupation isn&rsquo;t atypical for Delany, not that the occupation isn&rsquo;t tedious. </p>",
