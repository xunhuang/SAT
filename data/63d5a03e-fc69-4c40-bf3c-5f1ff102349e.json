  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. Since resin casting &ldquo;inevitably requires destroying the burrow,&rdquo; it would be impossible to make multiple castings of the same burrow over time. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn&rsquo;t discuss size requirements for completing resin casting, so there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage never mentions how long the casting process takes nor how long <em>A. bellulus</em> takes to construct a borrow, so there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage never states that recovering the model distorts the resin&rsquo;s shape, only that it destroys the burrow. Therefore, there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference. </p>",

  "stimulus": "<p>To better understand the burrowing habits of <em>Alpheus bellulus</em> (the tiger pistol shrimp), some studies have used resin casting to obtain precise measurements of the shrimps&rsquo; burrows. Resin casting involves completely filling an empty burrow with a liquid plastic that hardens to create a three-dimensional model; however, recovering the model inevitably requires destroying the burrow. In their 2022 study, Miyu Umehara and colleagues discovered that an x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner can accurately record a burrow&rsquo;s measurements both at a moment in time and throughout the entire burrow-building process, something that&rsquo;s impossible with resin casting because <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",
