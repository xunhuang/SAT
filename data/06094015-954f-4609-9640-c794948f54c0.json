  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period after &ldquo;configurations&rdquo; is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (&ldquo;The intense&hellip;configurations&rdquo;) and another (&ldquo;TMAO&hellip;fish&rdquo;). The supplementary phrase (&ldquo;ensuring&hellip;configurations&rdquo;) modifies the main clause of the first sentence (&ldquo;The chemical&hellip;effect&rdquo;), and &ldquo;TMAO&rdquo; is the subject of the second sentence. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences&nbsp; (&ldquo;The intense&hellip;configurations&rdquo; and &ldquo;TMAO&hellip;fish&rdquo;) are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice D is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join sentences. </p>",
