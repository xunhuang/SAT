  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a similarity between glaciers and icebergs in Greenland, noting that both melt and thereby contribute to rising sea levels.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence provides information about the melting rate of icebergs in Greenland; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a similarity between glaciers and icebergs in Greenland. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes a difference between glaciers and icebergs in Greenland, noting that their melting rates depend on different factors; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a similarity. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence explains the conditions under which glaciers in Greenland melt; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a similarity between glaciers and icebergs in Greenland.</p>",
