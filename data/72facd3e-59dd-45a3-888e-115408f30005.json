There&rsquo;s more than one photo, and nothing belongs to the photos, so the simple plural \"photos\" is correct.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses the singular possessive \"photo&rsquo;s,\" which isn&rsquo;t correct. There&rsquo;s more than one photo, and they don&rsquo;t possess anything, so the noun should be the simple plural \"photos.\" Choice B is incorrect.
