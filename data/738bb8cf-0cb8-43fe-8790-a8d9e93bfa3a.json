The table shows the highest average surface temperature of five areas and the percentage of bus stops with shaded shelter in each area, and 29% is the highest percentage listed.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the list of percentages of bus stops with shaded shelter does not include 50%; the highest percentage in the table is 29%. Choice B is incorrect because 15% is the lowest value in the listed percentages of bus stops with shaded shelter, not the highest value. Choice C is incorrect because the list of percentages of bus stops with shaded shelter does not include 90%; the highest percentage in the table is 29%.</p>",
