  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because. This quotation specifically describes a \"sense of detachment from ordinary day,\" which matches the claim&rsquo;s focus on \"escape from everyday life.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect.

Choice C is incorrect. This quotation focuses on where the journey begins, not on how it feels like an \"escape from everyday life.\"</p>",
