This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the main clause (\"The short...<em>Stars</em>\") and the supplementary element (\"an anthology...descent\") that provides additional information about what <em>Reclaim the Stars</em> is.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with \"an anthology.\" Choice B is incorrect. Joining the main clause and the following supplementary element with the conjunction \"while\" results in a confusing and ungrammatical sentence. Choice C is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause and the supplementary element with appropriate punctuation.</p>",
