  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of items in a complex series (a series including internal punctuation). The semicolon after &ldquo;nonnative&rdquo; is correctly used to separate the first item (&ldquo;growing diverse plant species, both native and nonnative&rdquo;) and the second item (&ldquo;fostering scientific research&rdquo;) in the series of things that botanical gardens are dedicated to. Further, the comma after &ldquo;species&rdquo; is correctly used to separate the noun phrase &ldquo;diverse plant species&rdquo; and the supplementary phrase &ldquo;both native and nonnative&rdquo; that modifies it. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a comma (specifically, the comma after &ldquo;nonnative&rdquo;) can&rsquo;t be used in this way to separate items in a complex series. Choice C is incorrect because a semicolon can&rsquo;t be used in this way to separate the noun phrase &ldquo;diverse plant species&rdquo; and the supplementary phrase &ldquo;both native and nonnative&rdquo; that modifies it. Further, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to separate items in a complex series. Choice D is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the noun phrase &ldquo;diverse plant species&rdquo; and the supplementary phrase &ldquo;both native and nonnative&rdquo; that modifies it. Further, a comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to separate items in a complex series. </p>",
