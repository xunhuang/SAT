  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a name and title and between a subject and a verb. No punctuation is needed between the proper noun &ldquo;Heather Grab&rdquo; and &ldquo;entomologist,&rdquo; the title that describes Grab. Additionally, no punctuation is needed between the sentence&rsquo;s subject (&ldquo;Entomologist Heather Grab&rdquo;) and the main verb (&ldquo;found&rdquo;) that indicates what Grab did. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed. Setting the entomologist&rsquo;s name off with commas suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn&rsquo;t the case. Choice D is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb. </p>",
