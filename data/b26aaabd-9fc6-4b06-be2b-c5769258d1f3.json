  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a main clause and a supplementary noun phrase. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the main clause (&ldquo;scholar&hellip;materialism&rdquo;) and the supplementary noun phrase (&ldquo;an apt assessment&rdquo;) that describes Waid&rsquo;s observation about how <em>The House of Mirth</em> depicts the upper classes of New York society. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a semicolon and the conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between a main clause and a supplementary noun phrase. Choice B is incorrect. Joining the main clause (&ldquo;scholar&hellip;materialism&rdquo;) and the following noun phrase with the conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; results in a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests that the novel depicts the upper classes of New York society as &ldquo;an apt assessment,&rdquo; which doesn&rsquo;t make sense in this context. Choice D is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause and the supplementary noun phrase with appropriate punctuation. </p>",
