  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. &ldquo;Demonstrating&rdquo; means &ldquo;showing,&rdquo; and the text describes how de Santana disproved a previous belief in only one species of electric eel by showing that three electric eel species actually exist. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Pretending that there are three species of electric eel might be a fun game for marine biologists, but it wouldn&rsquo;t prove the existence of more than one species. Choice B is incorrect. Complaining won&rsquo;t prove anything about eels, so de Santana could not have proved wrong the idea of only one species of electric eel by complaining about it. Choice C is incorrect. &ldquo;Requiring&rdquo; means &ldquo;needing.&rdquo; It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that de Santana &ldquo;needed&rdquo; there to be three distinct species of electric eel. </p>",
