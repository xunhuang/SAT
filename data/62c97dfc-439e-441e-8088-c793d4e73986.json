  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 states that Fontana&rsquo;s painting, which depicts a painting easel in the background, was made in 1577, eight years before Carracci&rsquo;s painting. Therefore, they might argue that Caracci was not &ldquo;the first artist&rdquo; to depict themself as a painter. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The texts don&rsquo;t support this choice. Neither text mentions the reputation or status of either Carracci or Fontana. Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does not comment on the intention or meaning of Fontana&rsquo;s self-depiction in <em>Self-Portrait at the Keyboard</em>. This choice also holds little connection to the underlined claim. Choice C is incorrect. The texts don&rsquo;t support this choice. The author of Text 2 does not suggest any inspirational relationship between Fontana and Carracci. The author of Text 2 is concerned with showing that Fontana&rsquo;s painting is the earliest example of an artist referring to painting in their self-portrait, but makes no mention of her influence on others. </p>",

  "stimulus": "<p><strong>Text 1</strong></p>\n<p>Italian painters in the 1500s rarely depicted themselves in their work. Even more rare were self-portrait paintings that portrayed the artist as a painter. At the time, painting was not yet respected as a profession, so painters mostly chose to emphasize other qualities in their self-portraits, like their intellect or social status. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">In the city of Bologna, the first artist to depict themself painting was a man named Annibale Carracci.</span> A painting of his from around 1585 shows Carracci in front of an easel holding a palette.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Text 2</strong></p>\n<p>In their self-portraits, Bolognese artists typically avoided referring to the act of painting until the mid-1600s. However, Lavinia Fontana&rsquo;s 1577 painting, <em>Self-Portrait at the Keyboard</em>, stands out as the earliest example of such a work by an artist from Bologna. Although the artist is depicted playing music, in the background, one can spot a painting easel by a window.</p>",
