  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase &ldquo;researcher Robert Losey&rdquo; the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase &ldquo;since&hellip;Siberia.&rdquo; In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that researcher Robert Losey&mdash;and not another noun in the sentence&mdash;is who uncovered fragments of a 2,000-year-old reindeer training harness in northern Siberia. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase &ldquo;researcher Robert Losey&rsquo;s argument&rdquo; immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the &ldquo;argument&rdquo; is what uncovered fragments of a 2,000-year-old reindeer training harness in northern Siberia. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun &ldquo;domestication&rdquo; immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that &ldquo;domestication&rdquo; is what uncovered fragments of a 2,000-year-old reindeer training harness in northern Siberia. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase &ldquo;the argument&rdquo; immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the &ldquo;argument&rdquo; is what uncovered fragments of a 2,000-year-old reindeer training harness in northern Siberia. </p>",
