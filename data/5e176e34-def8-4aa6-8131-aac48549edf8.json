  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence defines the term \"georeferencing,\" stating that it is the process of assigning geographic coordinates to an image so that mapping software can place the image in its real-world location.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes L&oacute;pez Marrero&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s 2017 project; it doesn&rsquo;t provide a definition of the term \"georeferencing.\" Moreover, it misrepresents the information in the notes by characterizing the team&rsquo;s assignment of geographic coordinates to photographs as a process distinct from georeferencing. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence states that L&oacute;pez Marrero&rsquo;s team used georeferencing, but it doesn&rsquo;t provide a definition of the term. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence explains why a particular group of georeferenced aerial photographs is potentially useful for researchers; it doesn&rsquo;t provide a definition of the term \"georeferencing.\"</p>",
