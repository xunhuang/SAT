  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of a restrictive coordinated noun phrase. No punctuation is needed within or around the coordinated noun phrase &ldquo;researchers Roberto Scandone and Christopher Kilburn&rdquo; because it would create an illogical separation between the noun &ldquo;researchers&rdquo; and the coordinated noun phrase &ldquo;Roberto Scandone and Christopher Kilburn.&rdquo; </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed. Placing a pair of commas around the coordinated noun phrase &ldquo;Roberto Scandone and Christopher Kilburn&rdquo; creates an illogical separation between the noun &ldquo;researchers&rdquo; and the aforementioned coordinated noun phrase. In this case, it illogically suggests that researchers in general bear the specific names Roberto Scandone and Christopher Kilburn. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the noun &ldquo;researchers&rdquo; and the coordinated noun phrase &ldquo;Roberto Scandone and Christopher Kilburn.&rdquo; Choice D is incorrect because no punctuation is needed within the coordinated noun phrase &ldquo;Roberto Scandone and Christopher Kilburn.&rdquo; </p>",
