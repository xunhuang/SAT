  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. &ldquo;Indicator&rdquo; means &ldquo;something that shows or suggests,&rdquo; which matches Taleb&rsquo;s argument that an item&rsquo;s age can suggest how much longer it will last. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The passage tells us that examining an item&rsquo;s age is the best way to predict how much longer it will last. Therefore, according to Taleb&rsquo;s theory, an item&rsquo;s age should add more certainty about how much longer it will last. Choice C is incorrect. A &ldquo;motivation&rdquo; is &ldquo;a reason for doing.&rdquo; Items don&rsquo;t have feelings and motivations, so it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that their age is a motivation for how much longer they will last. Choice D is incorrect. &ldquo;Criticism&rdquo; can mean &ldquo;describing faults or problems&rdquo; or &ldquo;an analysis of an artistic work.&rdquo; Neither of these definitions makes sense here. An item&rsquo;s age can&rsquo;t criticize how much longer it will last. </p>",
