  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a main clause and two supplementary elements. In this choice, the commas after &ldquo;nickname&rdquo; and &ldquo;however&rdquo; are correctly used to separate the supplementary adverb &ldquo;however&rdquo; from the main clause (&ldquo;Scott-Heron&hellip;nickname&rdquo;) on one side and the supplementary participial phrase (&ldquo;feeling&hellip;bluesologist&rdquo;) on the other. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the supplementary adverb &ldquo;however&rdquo; and the supplementary phrase (&ldquo;feeling&hellip;bluesologist&rdquo;).&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because a semicolon can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join the supplementary adverb &ldquo;however&rdquo; and the supplementary phrase (&ldquo;feeling&hellip;bluesologist&rdquo;). Choice D is incorrect because a semicolon can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join the main clause (&ldquo;Scott-Heron&hellip;nickname&rdquo;) and the supplementary word and phrase (&ldquo;however&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeling&hellip;bluesologist&rdquo;). Moreover, placing the semicolon after &ldquo;nickname&rdquo; illogically signals that the following information (Scott-Heron&rsquo;s feeling that the nickname didn&rsquo;t encapsulate his devotion to the blues tradition) is contrary to the information in the previous clause (Scott-Heron&rsquo;s resistance to the nickname). </p>",
