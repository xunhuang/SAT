  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes the thickness of lead-208&rsquo;s neutron skin, noting that it is about 0.28 trillionths of a millimeter thick.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The sentence makes a generalization about atoms, stating that atoms with excess neutrons will often acquire a neutron skin; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize the thickness of lead-208&rsquo;s neutron skin. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence states that lead-208 has a neutron skin; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize the thickness of that skin. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence indicates that lead-208 is surrounded by neutrons; it doesn&rsquo;t emphasize the thickness of lead-208&rsquo;s neutron skin.</p>",
