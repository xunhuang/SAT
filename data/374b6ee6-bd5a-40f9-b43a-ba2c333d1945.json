In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (\"In modern&hellip;audience\") and another (\"To do&hellip;performance\").</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with \"as.\" Choice B is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences (\"In modern&hellip;audience\" and \"To do&hellip;performance\") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences.</p>",
