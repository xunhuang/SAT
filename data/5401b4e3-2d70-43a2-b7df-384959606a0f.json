  "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that &ldquo;wishcycling&rdquo; is harmful, the previous sentence gives us an example, and this sentence gives us another example. So &ldquo;moreover&rdquo;&mdash;a transition that indicates the addition of another supporting point&mdash;fits perfectly here. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means &ldquo;appropriately&rdquo; or &ldquo;suitably,&rdquo; which doesn&rsquo;t make sense in context. This sentence adds another example of how &ldquo;wishcycling&rdquo; is harmful, so we&rsquo;re looking for an addition transition. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both provide examples of how &ldquo;wishcycling&rdquo; is harmful. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both provide examples of how &ldquo;wishcycling&rdquo; is harmful. </p>",
