  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer.&nbsp;The convention being tested is the use of punctuation around noun phrases. No punctuation is needed because the noun phrase &ldquo;aluminum oxide&rdquo; is a restrictive appositive, meaning that it provides essential identifying information about the noun phrase before it, &ldquo;the chemical compound,&rdquo; and thus doesn&rsquo;t require punctuation around it. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed. Choice C is incorrect because&nbsp;the noun phrase &ldquo;aluminum oxide&rdquo; is a restrictive appositive. Setting the phrase off with punctuation suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn&rsquo;t the case. </p>",
