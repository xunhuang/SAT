  "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Ward and colleagues&rsquo; findings. As used in this context, &ldquo;innocuous&rdquo; means mild or unharmful. The text describes the vibration and warming that Ward and colleagues used to alleviate itching as &ldquo;harmless applications&rdquo; and goes on to contrast these applications with another stimulus that actually offers more relief even though it seems to be stronger and &ldquo;less benign.&rdquo; This context conveys the idea that vibration and warming were innocuous stimuli.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a distinction between harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. Nothing in the text suggests that any of the treatments are &ldquo;deceptive,&rdquo; or misleading; indeed, even the less effective ones are described as offering some relief.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on the amount of relief from itching offered by harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. The text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that any of these stimuli are &ldquo;novel,&rdquo; or original and new; heat, vibration, and electricity aren&rsquo;t new inventions. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to describe an application of vibration or warming as &ldquo;impractical,&rdquo; or not suitable for use. The text indicates that these harmless applications are useful in that they offer at least some temporary relief. </p>",
