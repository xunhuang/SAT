  "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence compares the two proposed causes of crown shyness, noting the theories&rsquo; differences: Jacobs cites branches brushing against one another as the cause, while Ng cites branches detecting shade from other branches as the cause.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The sentence merely identifies the existence of two theories for crown shyness; it doesn&rsquo;t compare the causes proposed by each theory. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence merely indicates that there are two different theories for crown shyness; it doesn&rsquo;t compare the causes proposed by each theory. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence merely explains one theory for crown shyness; it doesn&rsquo;t compare two theories.</p>",
