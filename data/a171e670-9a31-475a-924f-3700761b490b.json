  "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence (\"The poem&hellip;exclamation\") and another sentence that begins with a supplementary element (\"Translated&hellip;poem\"). The supplementary element \"translated as &lsquo;hark!&rsquo; or &lsquo;listen!&rsquo; in some versions\" modifies the subject of the second sentence, \"the word\" (referring to <span lang=\"oe\">hw&aelig;t</span>).</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice after \"exclamation.\" A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice B is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction \"and\" can&rsquo;t be used in this way to join sentences. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice after \"versions.\" A comma can&rsquo;t be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences.</p>",
